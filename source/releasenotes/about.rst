What's New in |release|
=======================

Apache CloudStack |release| is a |version| LTS release with over FIXME major new
features, and over 100 enhancements and fixes since 4.14.  Highlights include:

• New modern UI (GA release)
• Support for CentOS8 and Ubuntu 20.04 as management server hosts and KVM hosts (note: CentOS 8 will EOL in Dec 2021)
• FIXME: add rest of new features

The full list of new features can be found in the project release notes at
http://docs.cloudstack.apache.org/en/4.15.0.0/releasenotes/changes.html

.. important::
   This version of CloudStack allows control over the visibility of the DNS services provided
   by the Virtual Router in Shared networks. By default CloudStack allows DNS queries via the
   Guest interface from any IP address. This allows for the DNS resolution of guest VMs on the
   Shared network by services outside of the shared network. While this can be useful, it can
   also be an issue on Shared Networks which are using Internet routable/public (i.e. non-RFC1918)
   IP addresses, as the DNS service is then queriable from the public internet at large. A new
   global setting "expose.dns.externally" has been added (with a default value of "true" in
   order to keep backward compatibility) which controls whether the source of DNS queries
   should be limited to only hosts on the Shared Network guest subnet or not. If you wish
   to disable 'outside' access to the DNS services running on Virtual Routers; set the value
   to "false" and recreate the related Virtual Routers.

Apache CloudStack powers numerous elastic Cloud computing services, including solutions that have
ranked as Gartner Magic Quadrant leaders. Highlighted in the Forrester Q4 2017 Enterprise Open Source
Cloud Adoption report, Apache CloudStack "sits beneath hundreds of service provider clouds", including
Fortune 5 multinational corporations. A list of known Apache CloudStack users are available
at http://cloudstack.apache.org/users.html

Libvirt Python Dependency on KVM and CentOS
===========================================

For CentOS users using the security groups feature on KVM it is needed to install the epel-release and python36-libvirt packages.

Workaround for adding newer KVM hosts
=====================================

Newer GNU/Linux distributions with latest OpenSSH package disables some older
SSH algorithms and ciphers and newer algorithms are not supported by trilead-ssh
library used by CloudStack to SSH into KVM hosts during the host-add operation.
Until the dependency library can support that users can use the following
workaround in their KVM host's /etc/ssh/sshd_config and restart ssh server
before adding the KVM host in CloudStack:

   PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes=+ssh-dss

   HostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-dss

   KexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1

New UI GA and Legacy UI Deprecation and Removal Notice
=======================================================

Cloudstack 4.15 ships with the GA release of a new and modern User Interface as
the default UI which deprecates the current legacy UI. With version 4.15, the
existing legacy UI (deprecated) along with the new UI are the supported UI for
production environments.

The default URL <host>:8080/client will serve the new UI and
<host>:8080/client/legacy will serve the deprecated legacy UI.

In the next release (4.16), the Apache Cloudstack community will remove the legacy
UI. Users are encouraged to implement a migration path towards deprecating the
legacy UI in their production environments.
