Possible Issue with volume snapshot revert with KVM
===================================================

Between versions 4.17.x, 4.18.0 and 4.18.1, KVM volume snapshot backups were
not full snapshots and they rely on the primary storage as a backing store.
To prevent any loss of data, care must be taken during revert operation and
it must be ensured that the source primary storage snapshot file is present
if the snapshot is created with any of these CloudStack versions.

Users will have a backing store in their volume snapshots in the following cases:

- the snapshots are from a ROOT volume created from template;

Users will not have a backing store in their volume snapshots in the following cases:

- the snapshots are from ROOT volumes created with ISO;
- the snapshots are from DATADISK volumes;

Following there are two queries to help users identify snapshots with a backing store:

Identify snapshots that were not removed yet and were created from a volume that was created from a template:

.. parsed-literal::
   SELECT  s.uuid AS "Snapshot ID",
           s.name AS "Snapshot Name",
           s.created AS "Snapshot creation datetime",
           img_s.uuid AS "Sec Storage ID",
           img_s.name AS "Sec Storage Name",
           ssr.install_path AS "Snapshot path on Sec Storage",
           v.uuid AS "Volume ID",
           v.name AS "Volume Name"
   FROM    cloud.snapshots s
   INNER   JOIN cloud.volumes v ON (v.id = s.volume_id)
   INNER   JOIN cloud.snapshot_store_ref ssr ON (ssr.snapshot_id = s.id
                                             AND ssr.store_role = 'Image')
   INNER   JOIN cloud.image_store img_s  ON (img_s.id = ssr.store_id)
   WHERE   s.removed IS NULL
   AND   v.template_id IS NOT NULL;

With that, one can use qemu-img info in the snapshot file to check if they have a backing store.

For those snapshots that have a backing store, one can use the following query to check which template is it and in which storage pool it is:

.. parsed-literal::
   SELECT  vt.uuid AS "Template ID",
         vt.name AS "Template Name",
         tsr.install_path AS "Template file on Pri Storage",
         sp.uuid AS "Pri Storage ID",
         sp.name AS "Pri Storage Name",
         sp.`path` AS "Pri Storage Path",
         sp.pool_type as "Pri Storage type"
   FROM    cloud.template_spool_ref tsr
   INNER   JOIN cloud.storage_pool sp ON (sp.id = tsr.pool_id AND sp.removed IS NULL)
   INNER   JOIN cloud.vm_template vt ON (vt.id = tsr.template_id)
   WHERE   tsr.install_path = "<template file in the snapshot backing store>";

After identifying the snapshots with a backing store and the related templates, one can mount the secondary storage on a host that has access to the template and use qemu-img convert on the snapshot to consolidate it:

.. parsed-literal::
   qemu-img convert -O qcow2 -U --image-opts driver=qcow2,file.filename=<path to snapshot on secondary storage> <path to snapshot on secondary storage>-converted
