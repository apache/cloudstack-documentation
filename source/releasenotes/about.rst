Possible Issue with Guest OS IDs
================================

It has been noticed during upgrade testing that some environment, where
custom guest OSses where added and mapping for those OSses where added,
problems may occur during upgrade. Part of the mitigation is to make sure
OSses that are newly mapped but should have already been in the guest_os
table are there. Make sure you apply those before you start the new 4.18
management server.

first check which of the guest_os entries you miss:

.. parsed-literal::

  SELECT * FROM cloud.guest_os WHERE display_name IN (´CentOS 8´, ´Debian GNU/Linux 10 (32-bit)´, ´Debian GNU/Linux 10 (64-bit)´, ´SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 (64-bit)´, ´Windows Server 2019 (64-bit)´)

Then apply any of the following lines that you might need.

.. parsed-literal::

  INSERT INTO cloud.guest_os (uuid, category_id, display_name, created, is_user_defined) VALUES (UUID(), '1', 'CentOS 8', now(), '0');
  INSERT INTO cloud.guest_os (uuid, category_id, display_name, created, is_user_defined) VALUES (UUID(), '2', 'Debian GNU/Linux 10 (32-bit)', now(), '0');
  INSERT INTO cloud.guest_os (uuid, category_id, display_name, created, is_user_defined) VALUES (UUID(), '2', 'Debian GNU/Linux 10 (64-bit)', now(), '0');
  INSERT INTO cloud.guest_os (uuid, category_id, display_name, created, is_user_defined) VALUES (UUID(), '5', 'SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 (64-bit)', now(), '0');
  INSERT INTO cloud.guest_os (uuid, category_id, display_name, created, is_user_defined) VALUES (UUID(), '6', 'Windows Server 2019 (64-bit)', now(), '0');
