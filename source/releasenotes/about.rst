.. note:: 
   This version of CloudStack allows control over the visibility of the DNS services provided
   by the Virtual Router. One can control whether the service on the routers be available to 
   networks outside the local network. This might be important on Shared Networks which are 
   using Internet routable/public (i.e. non-RFC 1918) IP addresses. The new global setting 
   "expose.dns.externally" has been added with a default value of "true" in order to keep backward compatibility
   with the previous installations. If you wish to disable public access to the DNS services
   running on Virtual Router, set the value to "false" and recreate the related Virtual Routers.

Apache CloudStack powers numerous elastic Cloud computing services, including solutions that have ranked as Gartner Magic Quadrant leaders. Highlighted in the Forrester Q4 2017 Enterprise Open Source Cloud Adoption report, Apache CloudStack "sits beneath hundreds of service provider clouds", including Fortune 5 multinational corporations.
