This implies, for example, that you will have the flexibility to upgrade a VR in a specified zone. As an administrator, you can also determine when a particular VR can be upgraded within a specified upgrade interval. Additionally, upgrade operation is enhanced to increase the upgrade speed by allowing as many upgrade operations in parallel as possible. During the entire duration of the upgrade, users cannot launch new services or make changes to an existing service."
