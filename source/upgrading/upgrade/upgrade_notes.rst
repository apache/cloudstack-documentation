General Upgrade Notes

---------------------------------

As of Apache CloudStack 4.14, Java version required is 11 for the
management-server, cloudstack-usage, KVM agent and system-VMs.


.. include:: _java_version.rst

UI Deprecation Notice
---------------------

The current jQuery-based CloudStack UI will be `deprecated
<http://markmail.org/message/vxnskmwhfaagnm4r/>`_ in the next Apache CloudStack
major release and removed in the subsequent future releases.

`Primate <https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-primate/>`_ will ship as the
modern UI for future Apache CloudStack releases. Users are encouraged to `test
<https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-primate/wiki/Migrating-to-Primate/>`_
Primate, report bugs and give feedback to the `dev community
<http://cloudstack.apache.org/mailing-lists.html>`_ with this release of Apache
CloudStack.

Migrating to dynamic roles feature
----------------------------------

As of Apache CloudStack 4.9, dynamic roles feature can be enabled after an
upgrade. Dyanamic roles feature is enabled by default on new installations.

Please read more about :ref:`using-dynamics-roles`
feature and process of migrating to using this after an upgrade.

Agent and KVM Host Security
---------------------------

Starting 4.11, a new CA framework has been introduced that is used to secure
agent and management server connections. Starting 4.11.1, KVM hosts in UP
state that are not secured (i.e. the KVM host agent and libvirtd don't have
CA framework provisioned X509 certificates) will show up as 'Unsecure'. A new
button in the UI is available as well as an API to secure and onboard such
hosts.

Please read more about :ref:`host-security` and the process of migrating existing KVM hosts and agents to use the new security
feature.

OVS plug-in
-----------

OVS plug-in functionality is disrupted if ovsdaemon crashes

A critical functionality issue came out with `CLOUDSTACK-6779 <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CLOUDSTACK-6779>`_. On XenServer it
is observed that on VIF unplug Ovs-Vswitchd is crashing resulting in loosing all
the openflow rules added to the bridge. Ovs daemon gets started and creates a
bridge but configure openflow rules are lost resulting in the disruption of
connectivity for the VM's on the host.


Active-Directory Authentication (LDAP)
--------------------------------------

If using Active-Directory (LDAP/LDAPs) as user authentication; Upgrading to 
4.3 and later require changes in Global Settings. After upgrading CloudStack
to 4.3 or latest, following Global Settings must be change:

.. cssclass:: table-striped table-bordered table-hover

======================= ============== ==============
Global Settings         Default        New
======================= ============== ==============
ldap.user.object        inetOrgPerson  user
ldap.username.attribute uid            sAMAccountName
======================= ============== ==============


SystemVM 32bit deprecated
