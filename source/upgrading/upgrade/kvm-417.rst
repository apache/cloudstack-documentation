KVM agents CPU speed detection issue
====================================

There is an issue with AMD (and possibly other CPU architectures) on the CPU speed detection at the 
4.17.0 and 4.17.0.1 CloudStack agents on KVM hosts at startup. The CloudStack agents will attempt to 
get the CPU speed  by reading the `/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/base_frequency` information. 
However, the CPU speed information is not included in all the CPU architectures.

The following property needs to be manually add to `/etc/cloudstack/agent/agent.properties` on the 
KVM hosts in order to fix such issue:
