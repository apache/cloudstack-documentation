msgid "Primary storage can be either static or dynamic. Static primary storage is what CloudStack has traditionally supported. In this model, the administrator must present CloudStack with a certain amount of preallocated storage (ex. a volume from a SAN) and CloudStack can place many of its volumes on this storage. In the newer, dynamic model, the administrator can present CloudStack with a storage system itself (i.e. a SAN). CloudStack, working in concert with a plug-in developed for that storage system, can dynamically create volumes on the storage system. A valuable use for this ability is Quality of Service (QoS). If a volume created in CloudStack can be backed by a dedicated volume on a SAN (i.e. a one-to-one mapping between a SAN volume and a CloudStack volume) and the SAN provides QoS functionality, then CloudStack can also orchestrate storage QoS."
