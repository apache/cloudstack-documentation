A Nexus virtual switch consists of two components: the Virtual Supervisor Module (VSM) and the Virtual Ethernet Module (VEM). The VSM is a virtual appliance that acts as the switch's supervisor. It controls multiple VEMs as a single network device. The VSM is installed independent of the VEM and is deployed in redundancy mode as pairs or as a standalone appliance. The VEM is installed on each VMware ESXi server to provide packet-forwarding capability. It provides each virtual machine with dedicated switch ports. This VSM-VEM architecture is analogous to a physical Cisco switch's supervisor (standalone or configured in high-availability mode) and multiple linecards architecture."

The vEthernet port profile is associated with the virtual NIC (vNIC) that is plumbed on a guest VM on the ESXi server. The port profiles help the network administrators define network policies which can be reused for new virtual machines.

VDS abstracts the configuration of individual virtual switches that span across a large number of hosts, and enables centralized provisioning, administration, and monitoring for your entire datacenter from a centralized interface. In effect, a VDS acts as a single virtual switch at the datacenter level and manages networking for a number of hosts in a datacenter from a centralized VMware vCenter server. Each VDS maintains network runtime state for VMs as they move across multiple hosts, enabling inline monitoring and centralized firewall services. A VDS can be deployed with or without Virtual Standard Switch and a Nexus 1000V virtual switch."
