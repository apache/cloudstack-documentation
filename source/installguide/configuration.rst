Configuring your CloudStack Installation
========================================

This section tells how to add regions, zones, pods, clusters, hosts,
storage, and networks to your cloud. If you are unfamiliar with these
entities, please begin by looking through :ref:`infrastructure-overview`


Overview of Provisioning Steps
------------------------------

After the Management Server is installed and running, you can add the
compute resources for it to manage. For an overview of how a CloudStack
cloud infrastructure is organized, see :ref:`infrastructure-overview`

To provision the cloud infrastructure, or to scale it up at any time,
follow these procedures:

#. Define regions (optional). See :ref:`adding-regions`.

#. Add a zone to the region. See :ref:`adding-a-zone`.

#. Add more pods to the zone (optional). See :ref:`adding-a-pod`.

#. Add more clusters to the pod (optional). See :ref:`adding-a-cluster`.

#. Add more hosts to the cluster (optional). See :ref:`adding-a-host`.

#. Add primary storage to the cluster. See :ref:`add-primary-storage`.

#. Add secondary storage to the zone. See :ref:`add-secondary-storage`.

#. Initialize and test the new cloud. See :ref:`initialize-and-test`.

When you have finished these steps, you will have a deployment with the
following basic structure:

.. _adding-regions:

Adding Regions (optional)
-------------------------

Grouping your cloud resources into geographic regions is an optional
step when provisioning the cloud. For an overview of regions, see :ref:`about-regions`


The First Region: The Default Region
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you do not take action to define regions, then all the zones in your
cloud will be automatically grouped into a single default region. This
region is assigned the region ID of 1. You can change the name or URL of
the default region by displaying the region in the CloudStack UI and
clicking the Edit button.


Adding a Region
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use these steps to add a second region in addition to the default
region.

#. Each region has its own CloudStack instance. Therefore, the first
   step of creating a new region is to install the Management Server
   software, on one or more nodes, in the geographic area where you want
   to set up the new region. Use the steps in the Installation guide.
   When you come to the step where you set up the database, use the
   additional command-line flag ``-r <region_id>`` to set a region ID
   for the new region. The default region is automatically assigned a
   region ID of 1, so your first additional region might be region 2.

   .. parsed-literal::

      # cloudstack-setup-databases cloud:<dbpassword>@localhost --deploy-as=root:<password> -e <encryption_type> -m <management_server_key> -k <database_key> -r <region_id>

#. By the end of the installation procedure, the Management Server
   should have been started. Be sure that the Management Server
   installation was successful and complete.

#. Now add the new region to region 1 in CloudStack.

   #. Log in to CloudStack in the first region as root administrator
      (that is, log in to <region.1.IP.address>:8080/client).

   #. In the left navigation bar, click Regions.

   #. Click Add Region. In the dialog, fill in the following fields:

      -  ID. A unique identifying number. Use the same number you set in
         the database during Management Server installation in the new
         region; for example, 2.

      -  Name. Give the new region a descriptive name.

      -  Endpoint. The URL where you can log in to the Management Server
         in the new region. This has the format
         <region.2.IP.address>:8080/client.

#. Now perform the same procedure in reverse. Log in to region 2, and
   add region 1.

#. Copy the account, user, and domain tables from the region 1 database
   to the region 2 database.

   In the following commands, it is assumed that you have set the root
   password on the database, which is a CloudStack recommended best
   practice. Substitute your own MySQL root password.

   #. First, run this command to copy the contents of the database:

      .. parsed-literal::

         # mysqldump -u root -p<mysql_password> -h <region1_db_host> cloud account user domain > region1.sql

   #. Then run this command to put the data onto the region 2 database:

      .. parsed-literal::

         # mysql -u root -p<mysql_password> -h <region2_db_host> cloud < region1.sql

#. Remove project accounts. Run these commands on the region 2 database:

   .. parsed-literal::

         # mysql> delete from account where type = 5;

#. Set the default zone as null:

   .. parsed-literal::

         # mysql> update account set default_zone_id = null;

#. Restart the Management Servers in region 2.


Adding Third and Subsequent Regions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add the third region, and subsequent additional regions, the steps
are similar to those for adding the second region. However, you must
repeat certain steps additional times for each additional region:

#. Install CloudStack in each additional region. Set the region ID for
   each region during the database setup step.

   .. parsed-literal::

      cloudstack-setup-databases cloud:<dbpassword>@localhost --deploy-as=root:<password> -e <encryption_type> -m <management_server_key> -k <database_key> -r <region_id>

#. Once the Management Server is running, add your new region to all
   existing regions by repeatedly using the Add Region button in the UI.
   For example, if you were adding region 3:

   #. Log in to CloudStack in the first region as root administrator
      (that is, log in to <region.1.IP.address>:8080/client), and add a
      region with ID 3, the name of region 3, and the endpoint
      <region.3.IP.address>:8080/client.

   #. Log in to CloudStack in the second region as root administrator
      (that is, log in to <region.2.IP.address>:8080/client), and add a
      region with ID 3, the name of region 3, and the endpoint
      <region.3.IP.address>:8080/client.

#. Repeat the procedure in reverse to add all existing regions to the
   new region. For example, for the third region, add the other two
   existing regions:

   #. Log in to CloudStack in the third region as root administrator
      (that is, log in to <region.3.IP.address>:8080/client).

   #. Add a region with ID 1, the name of region 1, and the endpoint
      <region.1.IP.address>:8080/client.

   #. Add a region with ID 2, the name of region 2, and the endpoint
      <region.2.IP.address>:8080/client.

#. Copy the account, user, and domain tables from any existing region's
   database to the new region's database.

   In the following commands, it is assumed that you have set the root
   password on the database, which is a CloudStack recommended best
   practice. Substitute your own MySQL root password.

   #. First, run this command to copy the contents of the database:

      .. parsed-literal::

         # mysqldump -u root -p<mysql_password> -h <region1_db_host> cloud account user domain > region1.sql

   #. Then run this command to put the data onto the new region's
      database. For example, for region 3:

      .. parsed-literal::

         # mysql -u root -p<mysql_password> -h <region3_db_host> cloud < region1.sql

#. Remove project accounts. Run these commands on the region 3 database:

   .. parsed-literal::

      mysql> delete from account where type = 5;

#. Set the default zone as null:

   .. parsed-literal::

      mysql> update account set default_zone_id = null;

#. Restart the Management Servers in the new region.


Deleting a Region
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Log in to each of the other regions, navigate to the one you want to
delete, and click Remove Region. For example, to remove the third region
in a 3-region cloud:

#. Log in to <region.1.IP.address>:8080/client.

#. In the left navigation bar, click Regions.

#. Click the name of the region you want to delete.

#. Click the Remove Region button.

#. Repeat these steps for <region.2.IP.address>:8080/client.


.. _adding-a-zone:

Adding a Zone
-------------

When you add a new zone, you will be prompted to configure the zone’s
physical network and add the first pod, cluster, host, primary storage,
and secondary storage.

#. Log in to the CloudStack UI as the root administrator. See :ref:`log-in-to-ui`.

#. In the left navigation, choose Infrastructure.

#. On Zones, click View More.

#. Click Add Zone. The zone creation wizard will appear.

#. Choose one of the following network types:

   -  **Basic.** For AWS-style networking. Provides a single network
      where each VM instance is assigned an IP directly from the
      network. Guest isolation can be provided through layer-3 means
      such as security groups (IP address source filtering).

   -  **Advanced.** For more sophisticated network topologies. This
      network model provides the most flexibility in defining guest
      networks and providing custom network offerings such as firewall,
      VPN, or load balancer support.

   -  **Security Groups.** You can choose to enable Security Groups in your zone.
      For further informations regarding Security Groups and there prequesits
      please refer to the Security Groups section in the documentation.

#. The rest of the steps differ depending on whether you chose Basic or
   Advanced. Continue with the steps that apply to you:

   -  `“Basic Zone Configuration” <#basic-zone-configuration>`_

   -  `“Advanced Zone Configuration” <#advanced-zone-configuration>`_


Basic Zone Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. After you select Basic in the Add Zone wizard and click Next, you
   will be asked to enter the following details. Then click Next.

   -  **Name.** A name for the zone.

   -  **DNS 1 and 2.** These are DNS servers for use by guest VMs in the
      zone. These DNS servers will be accessed via the public network
      you will add later. The public IP addresses for the zone must have
      a route to the DNS server named here.

   -  **Internal DNS 1 and Internal DNS 2.** These are DNS servers for
      use by system VMs in the zone (these are VMs used by CloudStack
      itself, such as virtual routers, console proxies, and Secondary
      Storage VMs.) These DNS servers will be accessed via the
      management traffic network interface of the System VMs. The
      private IP address you provide for the pods must have a route to
      the internal DNS server named here.

   -  **Hypervisor.** (Introduced in version 3.0.1) Choose the
      hypervisor for the first cluster in the zone. You can add clusters
      with different hypervisors later, after you finish adding the
      zone.

   -  **Network Offering.** Your choice here determines what network
      services will be available on the network for guest VMs.

      .. cssclass:: table-striped table-bordered table-hover

      ===============================================  ===================================================================================================================
      Network Offering                                 Description
      ===============================================  ===================================================================================================================
      DefaultSharedNetworkOfferingWithSGService        If you want to enable security groups for guest traffic isolation, choose this. (See Using Security Groups to                                                              Control Traffic to VMs.)
      DefaultSharedNetworkOffering                     If you do not need security groups, choose this.
      DefaultSharedNetscalerEIPandELBNetworkOffering   If you have installed a Citrix NetScaler appliance as part of your zone network, and you will be using its Elastic                                                         IP and Elastic Load Balancing features, choose this. With the EIP and ELB features, a basic zone with security                                                             groups enabled can offer 1:1 static NAT and load balancing.
      ===============================================  ===================================================================================================================


   -  **Network Domain.** (Optional) If you want to assign a special
      domain name to the guest VM network, specify the DNS suffix.

   -  **Public.** A public zone is available to all users. A zone that
      is not public will be assigned to a particular domain. Only users
      in that domain will be allowed to create guest VMs in this zone.

#. Choose which traffic types will be carried by the physical network.

   The traffic types are management, public, guest, and storage traffic.
   For more information about the types, roll over the icons to display
   their tool tips, or see Basic Zone Network Traffic Types. This screen
   starts out with some traffic types already assigned. To add more,
   drag and drop traffic types onto the network. You can also change the
   network name if desired.

#. Assign a network traffic label to each traffic type on the physical
   network. These labels must match the labels you have already defined
   on the hypervisor host. To assign each label, click the Edit button
   under the traffic type icon. A popup dialog appears where you can
   type the label, then click OK.

   These traffic labels will be defined only for the hypervisor selected
   for the first cluster. For all other hypervisors, the labels can be
   configured after the zone is created.

#. Click Next.

#. (NetScaler only) If you chose the network offering for NetScaler, you
   have an additional screen to fill out. Provide the requested details
   to set up the NetScaler, then click Next.

   -  **IP address.** The NSIP (NetScaler IP) address of the NetScaler
      device.

   -  **Username/Password.** The authentication credentials to access
      the device. CloudStack uses these credentials to access the
      device.

   -  **Type.** NetScaler device type that is being added. It could be
      NetScaler VPX, NetScaler MPX, or NetScaler SDX. For a comparison
      of the types, see About Using a NetScaler Load Balancer.

   -  **Public interface.** Interface of NetScaler that is configured to
      be part of the public network.

   -  **Private interface.** Interface of NetScaler that is configured
      to be part of the private network.

   -  **Number of retries.** Number of times to attempt a command on the
      device before considering the operation failed. Default is 2.

   -  **Capacity.** Number of guest networks/accounts that will share
      this NetScaler device.

   -  **Dedicated.** When marked as dedicated, this device will be
      dedicated to a single account. When Dedicated is checked, the
      value in the Capacity field has no significance – implicitly, its
      value is 1.

#. (NetScaler only) Configure the IP range for public traffic. The IPs
   in this range will be used for the static NAT capability which you
   enabled by selecting the network offering for NetScaler with EIP and
   ELB. Enter the following details, then click Add. If desired, you can
   repeat this step to add more IP ranges. When done, click Next.

   -  **Gateway.** The gateway in use for these IP addresses.

   -  **Netmask.** The netmask associated with this IP range.

   -  **VLAN.** The VLAN that will be used for public traffic.

   -  **Start IP/End IP.** A range of IP addresses that are assumed to
      be accessible from the Internet and will be allocated for access
      to guest VMs.

#. In a new zone, CloudStack adds the first pod for you. You can always
   add more pods later. For an overview of what a pod is, see :ref:`about-pods`

   To configure the first pod, enter the following, then click Next:

   -  **Pod Name.** A name for the pod.

   -  **Reserved system gateway.** The gateway for the hosts in that
      pod.

   -  **Reserved system netmask.** The network prefix that defines the
      pod's subnet. Use CIDR notation.

   -  **Start/End Reserved System IP.** The IP range in the management
      network that CloudStack uses to manage various system VMs, such as
      Secondary Storage VMs, Console Proxy VMs, and DHCP. For more
      information, see System Reserved IP Addresses.

#. Configure the network for guest traffic. Provide the following, then
   click Next:

   -  **Guest gateway.** The gateway that the guests should use.

   -  **Guest netmask.** The netmask in use on the subnet the guests
      will use.

   -  **Guest start IP/End IP.** Enter the first and last IP addresses
      that define a range that CloudStack can assign to guests.

      -  We strongly recommend the use of multiple NICs. If multiple
         NICs are used, they may be in a different subnet.

      -  If one NIC is used, these IPs should be in the same CIDR as the
         pod CIDR.

#. In a new pod, CloudStack adds the first cluster for you. You can
   always add more clusters later. For an overview of what a cluster is,
   see About Clusters.

   To configure the first cluster, enter the following, then click Next:

   -  **Hypervisor.** (Version 3.0.0 only; in 3.0.1, this field is read
      only) Choose the type of hypervisor software that all hosts in
      this cluster will run. If you choose VMware, additional fields
      appear so you can give information about a vSphere cluster. For
      vSphere servers, we recommend creating the cluster of hosts in
      vCenter and then adding the entire cluster to CloudStack. See Add
      Cluster: vSphere.

   -  **Cluster name.** Enter a name for the cluster. This can be text
      of your choosing and is not used by CloudStack.

#. In a new cluster, CloudStack adds the first host for you. You can
   always add more hosts later. For an overview of what a host is, see
   About Hosts.

   .. note::
      When you add a hypervisor host to CloudStack, the host must not have
      any VMs already running.

   Before you can configure the host, you need to install the hypervisor
   software on the host. You will need to know which version of the
   hypervisor software version is supported by CloudStack and what
   additional configuration is required to ensure the host will work
   with CloudStack. To find these installation details, see:

   -  Citrix XenServer Installation and Configuration

   -  VMware vSphere Installation and Configuration

   -  KVM vSphere Installation and Configuration

   To configure the first host, enter the following, then click Next:

   -  **Host Name.** The DNS name or IP address of the host.

   -  **Username.** The username is root.

   -  **Password.** This is the password for the user named above (from
      your XenServer or KVM install).

      One additional facility that is available in case of KVM is, host can also be added
      using CloudStack's SSH key without having to provide host password.

      Before adding the host in CloudStack do the following,

         - Copy the SSH public key from /var/cloudstack/management/.ssh/id_rsa.pub on the management server
         - Add the copied key to /root/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the host

      Select "System SSH Key" and proceed with next steps.

   -  **Host Tags.** (Optional) Any labels that you use to categorize
      hosts for ease of maintenance. For example, you can set this to
      the cloud's HA tag (set in the ha.tag global configuration
      parameter) if you want this host to be used only for VMs with the
      "high availability" feature enabled. For more information, see
      HA-Enabled Virtual Machines as well as HA for Hosts.

#. In a new cluster, CloudStack adds the first primary storage server
   for you. You can always add more servers later. For an overview of
   what primary storage is, see About Primary Storage.

   To configure the first primary storage server, enter the following,
   then click Next:

   -  **Name.** The name of the storage device.

   -  **Protocol.** For XenServer, choose either NFS, iSCSI, or
      PreSetup. For KVM, choose NFS, SharedMountPoint,CLVM, RBD or custom (for PowerFlex). For
      vSphere choose either VMFS (iSCSI or FiberChannel) or NFS. The
      remaining fields in the screen vary depending on what you choose
      here.


Advanced Zone Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. After you select Advanced in the Add Zone wizard and click Next, you
   will be asked to enter the following details. Then click Next.

   -  **Name.** A name for the zone.

   -  **DNS 1 and 2.** (DNS 1 obligatory)These are DNS servers for use by guest VMs in the
      zone. These DNS servers will be accessed via the public network
      you will add later. The public IP addresses for the zone must have
      a route to the DNS server named here.

   -  **Internal DNS 1 and Internal DNS 2.** (DNS 1 obligatory)
      These are DNS servers for use by system VMs in the zone(these are 
      VMs used by CloudStack itself, such as virtual routers, console
      proxies,and Secondary Storage VMs.) These DNS servers will be accessed via the
      management traffic network interface of the System VMs. The private
      IP address you provide for the pods must have a route to
      the internal DNS server named here.

   -  **Network Domain.** If you want to assign a special
      domain name to the guest VM network, specify the DNS suffix.

   -  **Hypervisor.** (Obligatory) Choose the hypervisor for the first
      cluster in the zone. You can add clusters with different hypervisors
      later, after you finish adding the zone.

   -  **Dedicated.** A dedicated zone is available to selected users or groups 
      within a domain. Only specified users or grous in that domain will 
      be allowed to create guest VMs in this zone.

   -  **Enable local storage for User VMs.** Give the user the opperunity to 
      provide local storage (physical storage on the host) for User VMs to store data.

   -  **Enable local storage for System VMs.** Give the system the opperunity to 
      use local storage (physical storage on the hosts) for System VMs.
	  
#. Click Next.

#. Choose which traffic types will be carried by the physical network.

   The traffic types are management, public, guest, and storage traffic.
   For more information about the types, roll over the icons to display
   their tool tips, or see :ref:`about-adv-network-traffic-types`.
   This screenstarts out with one network already configured. If you have
   multiple physical networks, you need to add more. Drag and drop traffic
   types onto a greyed-out network and it will become active. You can move the
   traffic icons from one network to another; for example, if the
   default traffic types shown for Network 1 do not match your actual
   setup, you can move them down. You can also change the network names
   if desired.

#. (Introduced in version 3.0.1) Assign a network traffic label to each
   traffic type on each physical network. These labels must match the
   labels you have already defined on the hypervisor host. To assign
   each label, click the Edit button under the traffic type icon within
   each physical network. A popup dialog appears where you can type the
   label, then click OK.

   These traffic labels will be defined only for the hypervisor selected
   for the first cluster. For all other hypervisors, the labels can be
   configured after the zone is created.

   (VMware only) If you have enabled Nexus dvSwitch in the environment,
   you must specify the corresponding Ethernet port profile names as
   network traffic label for each traffic type on the physical network.
   For more information on Nexus dvSwitch, see Configuring a vSphere
   Cluster with Nexus 1000v Virtual Switch in the Installation Guide. If
   you have enabled VMware dvSwitch in the environment, you must specify
   the corresponding Switch name as network traffic label for each
   traffic type on the physical network. For more information, see
   Configuring a VMware Datacenter with VMware Distributed Virtual
   Switch in the Installation Guide.

#. Click Next.

#. In a new zone, CloudStack adds the first pod for you. You can always
   add more pods later. For an overview of what a pod is, see :ref:`about-pods`

   To configure the first pod, enter the following, then click Next:

   see :ref:`about-clusters`

   To configure the first cluster, enter the following, then click Next:

   -  **Cluster name.** (Obligatory) Enter a name for the cluster. This can be text
      of your choosing and is not used by CloudStack.

#. In a new cluster, CloudStack adds the first host for you. You can
   always add more hosts later. For an overview of what a host is, see :ref:`about-hosts`.

   .. note::
      When you deploy CloudStack, the hypervisor host must not have any VMs
      already running.

   Before you can configure the host, you need to install the hypervisor
   software on the host. You will need to know which version of the
   hypervisor software version is supported by CloudStack and what
   additional configuration is required to ensure the host will work
   with CloudStack. To find these installation details, see:

   -  Citrix XenServer Installation for CloudStack

   -  **Password.** (Obligatory) This is the password for the user named above (from
      your XenServer or KVM install).

   .. note::
      For security reasons there are ways to use non-adminstrative users for
      adding a host. Please refer to the hypervisor setup guides for further information.	  

   -  **Host Tags.** Any labels that you use to categorize
      hosts for ease of maintenance. For example, you can set to the
      cloud's HA tag (set in the ha.tag global configuration parameter)
      if you want this host to be used only for VMs with the "high
      availability" feature enabled. For more information, see
      HA-Enabled Virtual Machines as well as HA for Hosts, both in the
      Administration Guide.

      The tag sets on primary storage across clusters in a Zone must be
      identical. For example, if cluster A provides primary storage that
      has tags T1 and T2, all other clusters in the Zone must also
      provide primary storage that has tags T1 and T2.

.. _installing-secondary-storage:

#. In a new zone, CloudStack connects the first secondary storage server for
   you. For an overview of what secondary storage is, see :ref:`about-secondary-storage`

   Before you can fill out this screen, you need to prepare the
   secondary storage by setting up NFS shares and installing the latest
   CloudStack System VM template. See Adding Secondary Storage :

   -  **NFS Server.** The IP address of the server or fully qualified
      domain name of the server.

   -  **Path.** The exported path from the server.

#. Click Launch.


.. _adding-a-pod:

Adding a Pod
------------

When you created a new zone, CloudStack adds the first pod for you. You
can add more pods at any time using the procedure in this section.

#. Log in to the CloudStack UI. See :ref:`log-in-to-ui`.

#. In the left navigation, choose Infrastructure. In Zones, click View
   More, then click the zone to which you want to add a pod.

#. Click the Compute and Storage tab. In the Pods node of the diagram,
   click View All.

#. Click Add Pod.

#. Enter the following details in the dialog.

   -  **Name.** The name of the pod.

   -  **Gateway.** The gateway for the hosts in that pod.

   -  **Netmask.** The network prefix that defines the pod's subnet. Use
      CIDR notation.

   -  **Start/End Reserved System IP.** The IP range in the management
      network that CloudStack uses to manage various system VMs, such as
      Secondary Storage VMs, Console Proxy VMs, and DHCP. For more
      information, see System Reserved IP Addresses.

#. Click OK.


.. _adding-a-cluster:

Adding a Cluster
----------------

You need to tell CloudStack about the hosts that it will manage. Hosts
exist inside clusters, so before you begin adding hosts to the cloud,
you must add at least one cluster.


Add Cluster: KVM or XenServer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These steps assume you have already installed the hypervisor on the
hosts and logged in to the CloudStack UI.

#. In the left navigation, choose Infrastructure. In Zones, click View
   More, then click the zone in which you want to add the cluster.

#. Click the Compute tab.

#. In the Clusters node of the diagram, click View All.

#. Click Add Cluster.

#. Choose the hypervisor type for this cluster.

#. Choose the pod in which you want to create the cluster.

#. Enter a name for the cluster. This can be text of your choosing and
   is not used by CloudStack.

#. Click OK.


Add Cluster: vSphere
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Host management for vSphere is done through a combination of vCenter and
the CloudStack admin UI. CloudStack requires that all hosts be in a
CloudStack cluster, but the cluster may consist of a single host. As an
administrator you must decide if you would like to use clusters of one
host or of multiple hosts. Clusters of multiple hosts allow for features
like live migration. Clusters also require shared storage such as NFS or
iSCSI.

For vSphere servers, we recommend creating the cluster of hosts in
vCenter and then adding the entire cluster to CloudStack. Follow these
requirements:

-  Do not put more than 8 hosts in a vSphere cluster

-  Make sure the hypervisor hosts do not have any VMs already running
   before you add them to CloudStack.

To add a vSphere cluster to CloudStack:

#. Create the cluster of hosts in vCenter. Follow the vCenter
   instructions to do this. You will create a cluster that looks
   something like this in vCenter.

   |vsphereclient.png: vSphere client|

#. Log in to the UI.

#. In the left navigation, choose Infrastructure. In Zones, click View
   More, then click the zone in which you want to add the cluster.

#. Click the Compute tab, and click View All on Pods. Choose the pod to
   which you want to add the cluster.

#. Click View Clusters.

#. Click Add Cluster.

#. In Hypervisor, choose VMware.

#. Provide the following information in the dialog. The fields below
   make reference to the values from vCenter.

   |addcluster.png: add a cluster|

   -  **Cluster Name**: Enter the name of the cluster you created in
      vCenter. For example, "cloud.cluster.2.2.1"

   -  **vCenter Host**: Enter the hostname or IP address of the vCenter
      server.

   -  **vCenter Username**: Enter the username that CloudStack should
      use to connect to vCenter. This user must have all the
      administrative privileges.

   -  **vCenter Password**: Enter the password for the user named above.

   -  **vCenter Datacenter**: Enter the vCenter datacenter that the
      cluster is in. For example, "cloud.dc.VM".

   -  **Dedicated**: When marked as dedicated, this device will be dedicated
      to a single account.

.. _adding-a-host:

Adding a Host
-------------

#. Before adding a host to the CloudStack configuration, you must first
   install your chosen hypervisor on the host. CloudStack can manage
   hosts running VMs under a variety of hypervisors.

   The CloudStack Installation Guide provides instructions on how to
   install each supported hypervisor and configure it for use with
   CloudStack. See the appropriate section in the Installation Guide for
   information about which version of your chosen hypervisor is
   supported, as well as crucial additional steps to configure the
   hypervisor hosts for use with CloudStack.

   .. warning::
      Be sure you have performed the additional CloudStack-specific
      configuration steps described in the hypervisor installation section for
      your particular hypervisor.

#. Now add the hypervisor host to CloudStack. The technique to use
   varies depending on the hypervisor.

   -  :ref:`adding-a-host-xenserver-kvm`

   -  :ref:`adding-a-host-vsphere`


.. _adding-a-host-xenserver-kvm:

Adding a Host (XenServer or KVM)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

XenServer and KVM hosts can be added to a cluster at any time.


Requirements for XenServer and KVM Hosts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. warning::
   Make sure the hypervisor host does not have any VMs already running before
   you add it to CloudStack.

Configuration requirements:

-  Each cluster must contain only hosts with the identical hypervisor.

-  For XenServer, do not put more than 8 hosts in a cluster.

-  For KVM, do not put more than 16 hosts in a cluster.

For hardware requirements, see the installation section for your
hypervisor in the CloudStack Installation Guide.


XenServer Host Additional Requirements
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

If network bonding is in use, the administrator must cable the new host
identically to other hosts in the cluster.

For all additional hosts to be added to the cluster, run the following
command. This will cause the host to join the master in a XenServer
pool.

.. parsed-literal::

   # xe pool-join master-address=[master IP] master-username=root master-password=[your password]

.. note::
   When copying and pasting a command, be sure the command has pasted as a
   single line before executing. Some document viewers may introduce unwanted
   line breaks in copied text.

With all hosts added to the XenServer pool, run the cloud-setup-bond
script. This script will complete the configuration and setup of the
bonds on the new hosts in the cluster.

#. Copy the script from the Management Server in
   /usr/share/cloudstack-common/scripts/vm/hypervisor/xenserver/cloud-setup-bonding.sh
   to the master host and ensure it is executable.

#. Run the script:

   .. parsed-literal::

      # ./cloud-setup-bonding.sh


KVM Host Additional Requirements
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

-  If shared mountpoint storage is in use, the administrator should
   ensure that the new host has all the same mountpoints (with storage
   mounted) as the other hosts in the cluster.

-  Make sure the new host has the same network configuration (guest,
   private, and public network) as other hosts in the cluster.

-  If you are using OpenVswitch bridges edit the file agent.properties
   on the KVM host and set the parameter network.bridge.type to
   openvswitch before adding the host to CloudStack

-  If you're using a non-root user to add a KVM host, please add the user to
   sudoers file:

   .. parsed-literal::

     cloudstack ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/cloudstack-setup-agent
     defaults:cloudstack !requiretty

Adding a XenServer Host
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. If you have not already done so, install the hypervisor software on
   the host. You will need to know which version of the hypervisor
   software version is supported by CloudStack and what additional
   configuration is required to ensure the host will work with
   CloudStack. To find these installation details, see the appropriate
   section for your hypervisor in the CloudStack Installation Guide.

#. Log in to the CloudStack UI as administrator.

#. In the left navigation, choose Infrastructure. In Zones, click View
   More, then click the zone in which you want to add the host.

#. Click the Compute tab. In the Clusters node, click View All.

#. Click the cluster where you want to add the host.

#. Click View Hosts.

#. Click Add Host.

#. Provide the following information.

   -  Host Name. The DNS name or IP address of the host.

   -  Username. Usually root.

   -  Password. This is the password for the user from your XenServer install).

   -  Host Tags (Optional). Any labels that you use to categorize hosts
      for ease of maintenance. For example, you can set to the cloud's
      HA tag (set in the ha.tag global configuration parameter) if you
      want this host to be used only for VMs with the "high
      availability" feature enabled. For more information, see
      HA-Enabled Virtual Machines as well as HA for Hosts.

   There may be a slight delay while the host is provisioned. It should
   automatically display in the UI.

#. Repeat for additional hosts.


Adding a KVM Host
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The steps to add a KVM host are same as adding a XenServer Host as mentioned in
the above section. 
One additional facility that is available in case of KVM is, host can also be added
using CloudStack's SSH key without having to provide host password.

Before adding the host in CloudStack do the following,

   - Copy the SSH public key from /var/cloudstack/management/.ssh/id_rsa.pub on the management server
   - Add the copied key to /root/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the host

While adding the host from CloudStack UI, select "System SSH Key" as shown below

   |add-Host.png: Adding a KVM Host|

.. _adding-a-host-vsphere:

Adding a Host (vSphere)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For vSphere servers, we recommend creating the cluster of hosts in
vCenter and then adding the entire cluster to CloudStack. See Add
Cluster: vSphere.


.. _add-primary-storage:

Add Primary Storage
-------------------

System Requirements for Primary Storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hardware requirements:

-  Any standards-compliant iSCSI, SMB, or NFS server that is supported
   by the underlying hypervisor.

-  The storage server should be a machine with a large number of disks.
   The disks should ideally be managed by a hardware RAID controller.

-  Minimum required capacity depends on your needs.

When setting up primary storage, follow these restrictions:

-  Primary storage cannot be added until a host has been added to the
   cluster.

-  If you do not provision shared primary storage, you must set the
   global configuration parameter system.vm.local.storage.required to
   true, or else you will not be able to start VMs.


Adding Primary Storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you create a new zone, the first primary storage is added as part
of that procedure. You can add primary storage servers at any time, such
as when adding a new cluster or adding more servers to an existing
cluster.

.. warning::
   When using preallocated storage for primary storage, be sure there is
   nothing on the storage (ex. you have an empty SAN volume or an empty NFS
   share). Adding the storage to CloudStack will destroy any existing data.

#. Log in to the CloudStack UI :ref:`log-in-to-ui`.

#. In the left navigation, choose Infrastructure. In Zones, click View
   More, then click the zone in which you want to add the primary
   storage.

#. Click the Compute tab.

#. In the Primary Storage node of the diagram, click View All.

#. Click Add Primary Storage.

#. Provide the following information in the dialog. The information
   required varies depending on your choice in Protocol.

   -  **Scope.** Indicate whether the storage is available to all hosts
      in the zone or only to hosts in a single cluster.

   -  **Pod.** (Visible only if you choose Cluster in the Scope field.)
      The pod for the storage device.

   -  **Cluster.** (Visible only if you choose Cluster in the Scope
      field.) The cluster for the storage device.

   -  **Name.** The name of the storage device.

   -  **Protocol.** For XenServer, choose either NFS, iSCSI, or
      PreSetup. For KVM, choose NFS, SharedMountPoint or custom (for PowerFlex). For vSphere
      choose either NFS, PreSetup (VMFS - iSCSI/FiberChannel, vSAN, vVols) or DatastoreCluster. For Hyper-V,
      choose SMB.

   -  **Server (for NFS, iSCSI, or PreSetup).** The IP address or DNS
      name of the storage device.

   -  **Server (for PreSetup or DatastoreCluster).** The IP address or DNS name of the vCenter
      server.

   -  **Path (for NFS).** In NFS this is the exported path from the
      server.

   -  **Path (for PreSetup or DatastoreCluster).** In vSphere this is a combination of the
      datacenter name and the datastore or datastore cluster name. The format is "/"
      datacenter name "/" datastore or datastore cluster name. For example,
      "/cloud.dc.VM/cluster1datastore".

   -  **Path (for SharedMountPoint).** With KVM this is the path on each
      host that is where this primary storage is mounted. For example,
      "/mnt/primary".

   -  **RADOS Monitor (for RBD).** With KVM, this is Ceph host domain/IP with
      port. For example, "round-robin.ceph-cluster.xyz:6789".

   -  **RADOS Pool (for RBD).** With KVM, this is Ceph pool name. For example,
      "cloudstack".

   -  **RADOS User (for RBD).** With KVM, this is Ceph client user name. For
      example, "cloudstack".

   -  **RADOS Secret (for RBD).** With KVM, this is the Ceph pool secret
      authorised for a client username. For example, "AQC3u/JfhipzGBAACiILEFKembN8gTJsIvu6nQ==".

   -  **SMB Username** (for SMB/CIFS): Applicable only if you select
      SMB/CIFS provider. The username of the account which has the
      necessary permissions to the SMB shares. The user must be part of
      the Hyper-V administrator group.

   -  **SMB Password** (for SMB/CIFS): Applicable only if you select
      SMB/CIFS provider. The password associated with the account.

   -  **SMB Domain**\ (for SMB/CIFS): Applicable only if you select
      SMB/CIFS provider. The Active Directory domain that the SMB share
      is a part of.

   -  **SR Name-Label (for PreSetup).** Enter the name-label of the SR
      that has been set up outside CloudStack.

   -  **Target IQN (for iSCSI).** In iSCSI this is the IQN of the
      target. For example, iqn.1986-03.com.sun:02:01ec9bb549-1271378984.

   -  **Lun # (for iSCSI).** In iSCSI this is the LUN number. For
      example, 3.

   -  **Tags (optional).** The comma-separated list of tags for this
      storage device. It should be an equivalent set or superset of the
      tags on your disk offerings..

   The tag sets on primary storage across clusters in a Zone must be
   identical. For example, if cluster A provides primary storage that
   has tags T1 and T2, all other clusters in the Zone must also provide
   primary storage that has tags T1 and T2.

#. Click OK.


Configuring a Storage Plug-in
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::
   Primary storage that is based on a custom plug-in (ex. SolidFire) must be
   added through the CloudStack API (described later in this section). There
   is no support at this time through the CloudStack UI to add this type of
   primary storage (although most of its features are available through the
   CloudStack UI).


SolidFire Plug-in
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::
   The SolidFire storage plug-in for CloudStack is part of the standard
   CloudStack install. There is no additional work required to add this
   component.

Adding primary storage that is based on the SolidFire plug-in enables
CloudStack to provide hard quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees.

When used with Compute or Disk Offerings, an administrator is able to
build an environment in which a root or data disk that a user creates
leads to the dynamic creation of a SolidFire volume, which has guaranteed
performance. Such a SolidFire volume is associated with one (and only
ever one) CloudStack volume, so performance of the CloudStack volume
does not vary depending on how heavily other tenants are using the
system.

The createStoragePool API has been augmented to support plugable storage
providers. The following is a list of parameters to use when adding
storage to CloudStack that is based on the SolidFire plug-in:

-  command=createStoragePool

-  scope=zone

-  zoneId=[your zone id]

-  name=[name for primary storage]

-  hypervisor=Any

-  provider=SolidFire

-  capacityIops=[whole number of IOPS from the SAN to give to
   CloudStack]

-  capacityBytes=[whole number of bytes from the SAN to give to
   CloudStack]

The url parameter is somewhat unique in that its value can contain
additional key/value pairs.

url=[key/value pairs detailed below (values are URL encoded; for
example, '=' is represented as '%3D')]

-  MVIP%3D[Management Virtual IP Address] (can be suffixed with :[port
   number])

-  SVIP%3D[Storage Virtual IP Address] (can be suffixed with :[port
   number])

-  clusterAdminUsername%3D[cluster admin's username]

-  clusterAdminPassword%3D[cluster admin's password]

-  clusterDefaultMinIops%3D[Min IOPS (whole number) to set for a volume;
   used if Min IOPS is not specified by administrator or user]

-  clusterDefaultMaxIops%3D[Max IOPS (whole number) to set for a volume;
   used if Max IOPS is not specified by administrator or user]

-  clusterDefaultBurstIopsPercentOfMaxIops%3D[Burst IOPS is determined
   by (Min IOPS \* clusterDefaultBurstIopsPercentOfMaxIops parameter)
   (can be a decimal value)]

PowerFlex Plug-in
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This plugin enables Dell EMC PowerFlex™ (v3.5) storage pools as a managed
primary storage in CloudStack for KVM hypervisor.

The PowerFlex/ScaleIO storage installation/setup and creation of the PowerFlex storage pool is
out of scope of this document. For PowerFlex storage installation instructions, Refer
to PowerFlex product documentation:
https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-in/product-support/product/scaleio/docs.

To know more details about PowerFlex, refer to
https://cpsdocs.dellemc.com/bundle/PF_KNOW/page/GUID-D6DFA46A-6085-47CE-88A9-B503EFC6CFD2.html.

When this storage pool is used with Compute or Disk Offerings, an administrator is
able to build an environment in which a root or data disk that a user creates leads
to the dynamic creation of a PowerFlex volume. This volume has guaranteed performance
with  the ScaleIO Data Client (SDC) limits specified in the offering using the details
parameter keys: bandwidthLimitInMbps &iopsLimit (both defaulted to 0 - unlimited).
Such a PowerFlex volume is associated with one (and only ever one) CloudStack volume,
so performance of the CloudStack volume does not vary depending on how heavily other
tenants are using the system. This volume migration is supported across PowerFlex storage
pools only, which are on same or distinct storage instance.

The createStoragePool API has been augmented to support plugable storage
providers. The following is a list of parameters to use when adding
storage to CloudStack that is based on the PowerFlex plug-in:

-  command=createStoragePool

-  scope=[zone | cluster]

-  zoneid=[your zone id]

-  podid=[your pod id, for cluster-wide primary storage]

-  clusterid=[your cluster id, for cluster-wide primary storage]

-  name=[name for primary storage]

-  hypervisor=KVM

-  provider=PowerFlex

-  url=[storage pool url]

The url parameter contains the PowerFlex storage pool details, specifed
in the following format:

powerflex://<API_USER>:<API_PASSWORD>@<GATEWAY>/<STORAGEPOOL>

-	<API_USER>=[user name for API access to PowerFlex gateway]

-	<API_PASSWORD>=[password for API access to PowerFlex gateway (password is URL encoded for example, '=' is represented as '%3D')]

-	<GATEWAY>=[PowerFlex gateway host]

-	<STORAGEPOOL>=[PowerFlex storage pool name (case sensitive)]

StorPool Plug-in
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::
   The StorPool storage plug-in for CloudStack is part of the standard
   CloudStack install. There is no additional work required to add this
   component.

The StorPool plug-in is deeply integrated with CloudStack and works on with KVM hypervisors.

When used with service or disk offerings, an administrator is able to
build an environment in which a root or data disk that a user creates
leads to the dynamic creation of a StorPool volume, which has guaranteed
performance. Such a StorPool volume is associated with one CloudStack volume,
so performance of the CloudStack volume does not vary depending on how
heavily other tenants are using the system. The volume migration is supported
accross non-managed storage pools (e.g. NFS/Local storage/Ceph) to StorPool, and
accross StorPool storage pools.

More technical details could be found on `StorPool Knowledge Base <https://kb.storpool.com/>`_.

The createStoragePool API has been augmented to support plugable storage providers.
The following is a list of parameters to use when adding storage to CloudStack that is based on the StorPool plug-in:

command=createStoragePool
scope=[zone]
zoneid=[your zone id]
hypervisor=KVM

Add Secondary Storage
---------------------

System Requirements for Secondary Storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  NFS storage appliance or Linux NFS server

-  SMB/CIFS (Hyper-V)

-  (Optional) OpenStack Object Storage (Swift) (see
   http://swift.openstack.org)

-  100GB minimum capacity

-  A secondary storage device must be located in the same zone as the
   guest VMs it serves.

-  Each Secondary Storage server must be available to all hosts in the
   zone.


Adding Secondary Storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you create a new zone, the first secondary storage is added as part
of that procedure. You can add secondary storage servers at any time to
add more servers to an existing zone.

.. warning::
   Ensure that nothing is stored on the server. Adding the server to
   CloudStack will destroy any existing data.

#. To prepare for the zone-based Secondary Staging Store, you should
   have created and mounted an NFS share during Management Server
   installation. See :ref:`prepare-nfs-shares`.

   If you are using an Hyper-V host, ensure that you have created a SMB
   share.

#. Make sure you prepared the system VM template during Management
   Server installation. See `“Prepare the System VM Template”
   <installation.html#prepare-the-system-vm-template>`_.

#. Log in to the CloudStack UI as root administrator.

#. In the left navigation bar, click Infrastructure.

#. In Secondary Storage, click View All.

#. Click Add Secondary Storage.

#. Fill in the following fields:

   -  Name. Give the storage a descriptive name.

   -  Provider. Choose S3, Swift, NFS, or CIFS then fill in the related
      fields which appear. The fields will vary depending on the storage
      provider; for more information, consult the provider's
      documentation (such as the S3 or Swift website). NFS can be used
      for zone-based storage, and the others for region-wide storage.
      For Hyper-V, select SMB/CIFS.

      .. warning::
         Heterogeneous Secondary Storage is not supported in Regions. You can
         use only a single NFS, S3, or Swift account per region.

   -  Create NFS Secondary Staging Store. This box must always be
      checked.

      .. warning::
         Even if the UI allows you to uncheck this box, do not do so. This
         checkbox and the three fields below it must be filled in. Even when
         Swift or S3 is used as the secondary storage provider, an NFS staging
         storage in each zone is still required.

   -  Zone. The zone where the NFS Secondary Staging Store is to be
      located.

   -  **SMB Username**: Applicable only if you select SMB/CIFS provider.
      The username of the account which has the necessary permissions to
      the SMB shares. The user must be part of the Hyper-V administrator
      group.

   -  **SMB Password**: Applicable only if you select SMB/CIFS provider.
      The password associated with the account.

   -  **SMB Domain**: Applicable only if you select SMB/CIFS provider.
      The Active Directory domain that the SMB share is a part of.

   -  NFS server. The name of the zone's Secondary Staging Store.

   -  Path. The path to the zone's Secondary Staging Store.


Adding an NFS Secondary Staging Store for Each Zone
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every zone must have at least one NFS store provisioned; multiple NFS
servers are allowed per zone. To provision an NFS Staging Store for a
zone:

#. Log in to the CloudStack UI as root administrator.

#. In the left navigation bar, click Infrastructure.

#. In Secondary Storage, click View All.

#. In Select View, choose Secondary Staging Store.

#. Click the Add NFS Secondary Staging Store button.

#. Fill out the dialog box fields, then click OK:

   -  Zone. The zone where the NFS Secondary Staging Store is to be
      located.

   -  NFS server. The name of the zone's Secondary Staging Store.

   -  Path. The path to the zone's Secondary Staging Store.


.. _initialize-and-test:

Initialize and Test
-------------------

After everything is configured, CloudStack will perform its
initialization. This can take 30 minutes or more, depending on the speed
of your network. When the initialization has completed successfully, the
administrator's Dashboard should be displayed in the CloudStack UI.

#. Verify that the system is ready. In the left navigation bar, select
   Templates. Click on the CentOS 5.5 (64bit) no Gui (KVM) template.
   Check to be sure that the status is "Download Complete." Do not
   proceed to the next step until this status is displayed.

#. Go to the Instances tab, and filter by My Instances.

#. Click Add Instance and follow the steps in the wizard.

   #. Choose the zone you just added.

   #. In the template selection, choose the template to use in the VM.
      If this is a fresh installation, likely only the provided CentOS
      template is available.

   #. Select a service offering. Be sure that the hardware you have
      allows starting the selected service offering.

   #. In data disk offering, if desired, add another data disk. This is
      a second volume that will be available to but not mounted in the
      guest. For example, in Linux on XenServer you will see /dev/xvdb
      in the guest after rebooting the VM. A reboot is not required if
      you have a PV-enabled OS kernel in use.

   #. In default network, choose the primary network for the guest. In a
      trial installation, you would have only one option here.

   #. Optionally give your VM a name and a group. Use any descriptive
      text you would like.

   #. Click Launch VM. Your VM will be created and started. It might
      take some time to download the template and complete the VM
      startup. You can watch the VMâ€™s progress in the Instances
      screen.

#. To use the VM, click the View Console button. |ConsoleButton.png:
   button to launch a console|

   For more information about using VMs, including instructions for how
   to allow incoming network traffic to the VM, start, stop, and delete
   VMs, and move a VM from one host to another, see Working With Virtual
   Machines in the Administratorâ€™s Guide.

Congratulations! You have successfully completed a CloudStack
Installation.

If you decide to grow your deployment, you can add more hosts, primary
storage, zones, pods, and clusters.

.. _configuration-parameters:

Configuration Parameters
------------------------

About Configuration Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CloudStack provides a variety of settings you can use to set limits,
configure features, and enable or disable features in the cloud. Once
your Management Server is running, you might need to set some of these
configuration parameters, depending on what optional features you are
setting up. You can set default values at the global level, which will
be in effect throughout the cloud unless you override them at a lower
level. You can make local settings, which will override the global
configuration parameter values, at the level of an account, zone,
cluster, or primary storage.

The documentation for each CloudStack feature should direct you to the
names of the applicable parameters. The following table shows a few of
the more useful parameters.

.. cssclass:: table-striped table-bordered table-hover

=================================  ================================================================================
Field                              Value
=================================  ================================================================================
management.network.cidr            A CIDR that describes the network that the management CIDRs reside on. This                                        variable must be set for deployments that use vSphere. It is recommended to be                                     set for other deployments as well. Example: 192.168.3.0/24.
xen.setup.multipath                For XenServer nodes, this is a true/false variable that instructs CloudStack to                                    enable iSCSI multipath on the XenServer Hosts when they are added. This                                            defaults to false. Set it to true if you would like CloudStack to enable                                           multipath.If this is true for a NFS-based deployment multipath will still be                                       enabled on the XenServer host. However, this does not impact NFS operation and                                     is harmless.
secstorage.allowed.internal.sites  This is used to protect your internal network from rogue attempts to download                                      arbitrary files using the template download feature. This is a comma-separated                                     list of CIDRs. If a requested URL matches any of these CIDRs the Secondary                                         Storage VM will use the private network interface to fetch the URL. Other URLs                                     will go through the public interface. We suggest you set this to 1 or 2                                            hardened internal machines where you keep your templates. For example, set it                                      to 192.168.1.66/32.
use.local.storage                  Determines whether CloudStack will use storage that is local to the Host for                                       data disks, templates, and snapshots. By default CloudStack will not use this                                      storage. You should change this to true if you want to use local storage and                                       you understand the reliability and feature drawbacks to choosing local storage.
host                               This is the IP address of the Management Server. If you are using multiple                                         Management Servers you should enter a load balanced IP address that is                                             reachable via the private network.
default.page.size                  Maximum number of items per page that can be returned by a CloudStack API                                          command. The limit applies at the cloud level and can vary from cloud to cloud.                                    You can override this with a lower value on a particular API call by using the                                     page and pagesize API command parameters. For more information, see the                                            Developer's Guide. Default: 500.
ha.tag                             The label you want to use throughout the cloud to designate certain hosts as                                       dedicated HA hosts. These hosts will be used only for HA-enabled VMs that are                                      restarting due to the failure of another host. For example, you could set this                                     to ha\_host. Specify the ha.tag value asa host tag when you add a new host to                                      the cloud.
vmware.vcenter.session.timeout     Determines the vCenter session timeout value by using this parameter. The                                          default value is 20 minutes. Increase the timeout value to avoid timeout errors                                    in VMware deployments because certain VMware operations take more than 20                                          minutes.
