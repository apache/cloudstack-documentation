Server and multiple Management Servers|

What should you do next?

-  Even without adding any cloud infrastructure, you can run the UI to
   get a feel for what's offered and how you will interact with
   CloudStack on an ongoing basis. See Log In to the UI.

-  When you're ready, add the cloud infrastructure and try running some
   Instances on it, so you can watch how CloudStack manages the
   infrastructure. See Provision Your Cloud Infrastructure.
