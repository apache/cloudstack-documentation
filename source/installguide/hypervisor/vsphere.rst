Host VMware vSphere Installation
--------------------------------

If you want to use the VMware vSphere hypervisor to run guest virtual
machines, install vSphere on the host(s) in your cloud.


System Requirements for vSphere Hosts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Software requirements:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  vSphere and vCenter, versions 6.0, 6.5 or 6.7.

   vSphere Standard is recommended. Note however that customers need to
   consider the CPU constraints in place with vSphere licensing. See
   `http://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/vsphere\_pricing.pdf 
   <http://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/vsphere_pricing.pdf>`_
   and discuss with your VMware sales representative.

   vCenter Server Standard is recommended.

-  Be sure all the hotfixes provided by the hypervisor vendor are
   applied. Track the release of hypervisor patches through your
   hypervisor vendor's support channel, and apply patches as soon as
   possible after they are released. CloudStack will not track or notify
   you of required hypervisor patches. It is essential that your hosts
   are completely up to date with the provided hypervisor patches. The
   hypervisor vendor is likely to refuse to support any system that is
   not up to date with patches.

.. warning:: 
   Apply All Necessary Hotfixes. The lack of up-do-date hotfixes can lead to 
   data corruption and lost VMs.

.. note::

   When using vSphere and vCenter versions 6.0 and 6.5 there is a limitation on
   instance names with a sequence number between 99999 and 1000000. For example if you take
   a snapshot of a VM, the expected filename will be different to what cloudstack expects.
   It is advisable to set the sequence number to 1M to prevent issues by executing the
   following script on your cloudstack database:

   UPDATE cloud.sequence
   SET value = 1000000
   WHERE name = 'vm_instance_seq';

Hardware requirements:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  The host must be certified as compatible with vSphere. See the VMware
   Hardware Compatibility Guide at
   `http://www.vmware.com/resources/compatibility/search.php 
   <http://www.vmware.com/resources/compatibility/search.php>`_.

-  All hosts must be 64-bit and must support HVM (Intel-VT or AMD-V
   enabled).

-  All hosts within a cluster must be homogenous. That means the CPUs
   must be of the same type, count, and feature flags.

-  64-bit x86 CPU (more cores results in better performance)

-  Hardware virtualization support required

-  4 GB of memory

-  36 GB of local disk

-  At least 1 NIC

-  Statically allocated IP Address


vCenter Server requirements:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Processor - 2 CPUs 2.0GHz or higher Intel or AMD x86 processors.
   Processor requirements may be higher if the database runs on the same
   machine.

-  Memory - 3GB RAM. RAM requirements may be higher if your database
   runs on the same machine.

-  Disk storage - 2GB. Disk requirements may be higher if your database
   runs on the same machine.

-  Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Express disk requirements. The bundled
   database requires up to 2GB free disk space to decompress the
   installation archive.

-  Networking - 1Gbit or 10Gbit.

For more information, see `"vCenter Server and the vSphere Client Hardware 
Requirements" <http://pubs.vmware.com/vsp40/wwhelp/wwhimpl/js/html/wwhelp.htm#href=install/c_vc_hw.html>`_.


Other requirements:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  VMware vCenter Standard Edition 6.0, 6.5 or 6.7 must be installed and
   available to manage the vSphere hosts.

-  vCenter must be configured to use the standard port 443 so that it
   can communicate with the CloudStack Management Server.

-  You must re-install VMware ESXi if you are going to re-use a host
   from a previous install.

-  CloudStack requires VMware vSphere 6.0, 6.5 or 6.7. VMware vSphere 5.5 and older
   not supported.

-  All hosts must be 64-bit and must support HVM (Intel-VT or AMD-V
   enabled). All hosts within a cluster must be homogeneous. That means
   the CPUs must be of the same type, count, and feature flags.

-  The CloudStack management network must not be configured as a
   separate virtual network. The CloudStack management network is the
   same as the vCenter management network, and will inherit its
   configuration. See :ref:`configure-vcenter-management-network`.

-  CloudStack requires ESXi and vCenter. ESX is not supported.

-  Ideally all resources used for CloudStack must be used for CloudStack only.
   CloudStack should not share instance of ESXi or storage with other
   management consoles. Do not share the same storage volumes that will
   be used by CloudStack with a different set of ESXi servers that are
   not managed by CloudStack.

-  Put all target ESXi hypervisors in dedicated clusters in a separate Datacenter
   in vCenter.

-  Ideally clusters that will be managed by CloudStack should not contain
   any other VMs. Do not run the management server or vCenter on
   the cluster that is designated for CloudStack use. Create a separate
   cluster for use of CloudStack and make sure that they are no VMs in
   this cluster.

-  All of the required VLANs must be trunked into all network switches that
   are connected to the ESXi hypervisor hosts. These would include the
   VLANs for Management, Storage, vMotion, and guest VLANs. The guest
   VLAN (used in Advanced Networking; see Network Setup) is a contiguous
   range of VLANs that will be managed by CloudStack.

   ====================================================================================================== ===================


ESXi Host setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All ESXi hosts should have CPU hardware virtualization support enabled in
the BIOS. Please note hardware virtualization support is not enabled by
default on most servers.


Physical Host Networking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You should have a plan for cabling the vSphere hosts. Proper network
configuration is required before adding a vSphere host to CloudStack. To
configure an ESXi host, you can use vClient to add it as standalone host
to vCenter first. Once you see the host appearing in the vCenter
inventory tree, click the host node in the inventory tree, and navigate
to the Configuration tab.

|vspherephysicalnetwork.png: vSphere client|

In the host configuration tab, click the "Hardware/Networking" link to
bring up the networking configuration page as above.


Configure Virtual Switch
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

During the initial installation of an ESXi host a default virtual switch
vSwitch0 is created. You may need to create additional vSwiches depending
on your required architecture. CloudStack requires all ESXi hosts in the cloud
to use consistently named virtual switches. If
you change the default virtual switch name, you will need to configure
one or more CloudStack configuration variables as well.


Separating Traffic
''''''''''''''''''

CloudStack allows you to configure three separate networks per ESXi host.
CloudStack identifies these networks by the name of the vSwitch
they are connected to. The networks for configuration are public (for
traffic to/from the public internet), guest (for guest-guest traffic),
and private (for management and usually storage traffic). You can use
the default virtual switch for all three, or create one or two other
vSwitches for those traffic types.

If you want to separate traffic in this way you should first create and
configure vSwitches in vCenter according to the vCenter instructions.
Take note of the vSwitch names you have used for each traffic type. You
will configure CloudStack to use these vSwitches.


Increasing Ports
''''''''''''''''

By default a virtual switch on ESXi hosts is created with 56 ports. We
recommend setting it to 4088, the maximum number of ports allowed. To do
that, click the "Properties..." link for virtual switch (note this is
not the Properties link for Networking).

|vsphereincreaseports.png: vSphere client|

In vSwitch properties dialog, select the vSwitch and click Edit. You
should see the following dialog:

|vspherevswitchproperties.png: vSphere client|

In this dialog, you can change the number of switch ports. After you've
done that, ESXi hosts are required to reboot in order for the setting to
take effect.


.. _configure-vcenter-management-network:

Configure vCenter Management Network
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the vSwitch properties dialog box, you may see a vCenter management
network. This same network will also be used as the CloudStack
management network. CloudStack requires the vCenter management network
to be configured properly. Select the management network item in the
dialog, then click Edit.

|vspheremgtnetwork.png: vSphere client|

Make sure the following values are set:

-  VLAN ID set to the desired ID

-  vMotion enabled.

-  Management traffic enabled.

If the ESXi hosts have multiple VMKernel ports, and ESXi is not using
the default value "Management Network" as the management network name,
you must follow these guidelines to configure the management network
port group so that CloudStack can find it:

-  Use one label for the management network port across all ESXi hosts.

-  In the CloudStack UI, go to Configuration - Global Settings and set
   vmware.management.portgroup to the management network label from the
   ESXi hosts.


Extend Port Range for CloudStack Console Proxy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In production environments (large number of VMs), 
it's needed to extend the range of firewall ports that the console proxy
works with on the hosts. The default additional port range is 50000-50999
(see global settings ``vmware.additional.vnc.portrange.size`` and ``vmware.additional.vnc.portrange.start``).
 
Change global setting ``vmware.additional.vnc.portrange.size`` to i.e "10000" and restart the 
management-server service on each management server.
Add those additional ports to the ESXi firewall on each host.
Log in via SSH to every VMware ESXi host and edit the file ``/etc/rc.local.d/local.sh``
by adding the following lines just above the "exit 0" line.:

.. parsed-literal::

   cat <<EOF > /etc/vmware/firewall/vncAdditionalPorts.xml
   <ConfigRoot>
     <service>
       <id>vncAdditionalPorts</id>
       <rule id='0000'>
         <direction>inbound</direction>
         <protocol>tcp</protocol>
         <porttype>dst</porttype>
         <port>
           <begin>51000</begin>
           <end>60000</end>
         </port>
       </rule>
       <enabled>true</enabled>
       <required>false</required>
     </service>
   </ConfigRoot>
   EOF
   esxcli network firewall refresh

This will ensure the needed firewall rules are applied on boot of ESXi hosts.

To make the change on the running host, repeat the commands that were just added to ``local.sh`` script, at the shell command line:

.. parsed-literal::

   cat <<EOF > /etc/vmware/firewall/vncAdditionalPorts.xml
   <ConfigRoot>
     <service>
       <id>vncAdditionalPorts</id>
       <rule id='0000'>
         <direction>inbound</direction>
         <protocol>tcp</protocol>
         <porttype>dst</porttype>
         <port>
           <begin>51000</begin>
           <end>60000</end>
         </port>
       </rule>
       <enabled>true</enabled>
       <required>false</required>
     </service>
   </ConfigRoot>
   EOF
   esxcli network firewall refresh
   
Run the script ``/sbin/auto-backup.sh`` and then logout from each ESXi host.

Configure NIC Bonding for vSphere
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

NIC bonding on vSphere hosts may be done according to the vSphere
installation guide.

.. _configuring-a-vsphere-cluster-with-nexus-1000v-virtual-switch:

Configuring a vSphere Cluster with Nexus 1000v Virtual Switch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CloudStack supports Cisco Nexus 1000v dvSwitch (Distributed Virtual
Switch) for virtual network configuration in a VMware vSphere
environment. This section helps you configure a vSphere cluster with
Nexus 1000v virtual switch in a VMware vCenter environment. For
information on creating a vSphere cluster, see 
`"VMware vSphere Installation and Configuration" 
<#vmware-vsphere-installation-and-configuration>`_


About Cisco Nexus 1000v Distributed Virtual Switch
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Cisco Nexus 1000V virtual switch is a software-based virtual machine
access switch for VMware vSphere environments. It can span multiple
hosts running VMware ESXi 4.0 and later. A Nexus virtual switch consists
of two components: the Virtual Supervisor Module (VSM) and the Virtual
Ethernet Module (VEM). The VSM is a virtual appliance that acts as the
switch's supervisor. It controls multiple VEMs as a single network
device. The VSM is installed independent of the VEM and is deployed in
redundancy mode as pairs or as a standalone appliance. The VEM is
installed on each VMware ESXi server to provide packet-forwarding
capability. It provides each virtual machine with dedicated switch
ports. This VSM-VEM architecture is analogous to a physical Cisco
switch's supervisor (standalone or configured in high-availability mode)
and multiple linecards architecture.

Nexus 1000v switch uses vEthernet port profiles to simplify network
provisioning for virtual machines. There are two types of port profiles:
Ethernet port profile and vEthernet port profile. The Ethernet port
profile is applied to the physical uplink ports-the NIC ports of the
physical NIC adapter on an ESXi server. The vEthernet port profile is
associated with the virtual NIC (vNIC) that is plumbed on a guest VM on
the ESXi server. The port profiles help the network administrators
define network policies which can be reused for new virtual machines.
The Ethernet port profiles are created on the VSM and are represented as
port groups on the vCenter server.


Prerequisites and Guidelines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section discusses prerequisites and guidelines for using Nexus
virtual switch in CloudStack. Before configuring Nexus virtual switch,
ensure that your system meets the following requirements:

-  A cluster of servers (ESXi 4.1 or later) is configured in the
   vCenter.

-  Each cluster managed by CloudStack is the only cluster in its vCenter
   datacenter.

-  A Cisco Nexus 1000v virtual switch is installed to serve the
   datacenter that contains the vCenter cluster. This ensures that
   CloudStack doesn't have to deal with dynamic migration of virtual
   adapters or networks across other existing virtual switches. See
   `Cisco Nexus 1000V Installation and Upgrade Guide 
   <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus1000/sw/4_2_1_s_v_1_5_1/install_upgrade/vsm_vem/guide/n1000v_installupgrade.html>`_
   for guidelines on how to install the Nexus 1000v VSM and VEM modules.

-  The Nexus 1000v VSM is not deployed on a vSphere host that is managed
   by CloudStack.

-  When the maximum number of VEM modules per VSM instance is reached,
   an additional VSM instance is created before introducing any more
   ESXi hosts. The limit is 64 VEM modules for each VSM instance.

-  CloudStack expects that the Management Network of the ESXi host is
   configured on the standard vSwitch and searches for it in the
   standard vSwitch. Therefore, ensure that you do not migrate the
   management network to Nexus 1000v virtual switch during
   configuration.

'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''                                          

You will need the following information about vCenter:

.. cssclass:: table-striped table-bordered table-hover

=============================  =========  =============================================================================
Nexus vSwitch Requirements     Value      Notes
=============================  =========  =============================================================================

Network Configuration Checklist
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''                                            

The following information specified in the Nexus Configure Networking
screen is displayed in the Details tab of the Nexus dvSwitch in the
CloudStack UI:

**Control Port Group VLAN ID**
The VLAN ID of the Control Port Group. The control VLAN is used for 
communication between the VSM and the VEMs.

**Management Port Group VLAN ID**
The VLAN ID of the Management Port Group. The management VLAN corresponds to 
the mgmt0 interface that is used to establish and maintain the connection 
between the VSM and VMware vCenter Server.

**Packet Port Group VLAN ID**
The VLAN ID of the Packet Port Group. The packet VLAN forwards relevant data 
packets from the VEMs to the VSM.

.. note::
   The VLANs used for control, packet, and management port groups can be the 
   same.

For more information, see `Cisco Nexus 1000V Getting Started Guide 
<http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus1000/sw/4_2_1_s_v_1_4_b/getting_started/configuration/guide/n1000v_gsg.pdf>`_.


VSM Configuration Checklist
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''                                        

You will need the following VSM configuration parameters:

**Admin Name and Password**
The admin name and password to connect to the VSM appliance. You must specify 
these credentials while configuring Nexus virtual switch.

**Management IP Address**
This is the IP address of the VSM appliance. This is the IP address you 
specify in the virtual switch IP Address field while configuting Nexus virtual 
switch.

**SSL**
Should be set to Enable.Always enable SSL. SSH is usually enabled by default 
during the VSM installation. However, check whether the SSH connection to the 
VSM is working, without which CloudStack failes to connect to the VSM.


Creating a Port Profile
'''''''''''''''''''''''

-  Whether you create a Basic or Advanced zone configuration, ensure
   that you always create an Ethernet port profile on the VSM after you
   install it and before you create the zone.

   -  The Ethernet port profile created to represent the physical
      network or networks used by an Advanced zone configuration trunk
      all the VLANs including guest VLANs, the VLANs that serve the
      native VLAN, and the packet/control/data/management VLANs of the
      VSM.

   -  The Ethernet port profile created for a Basic zone configuration
      does not trunk the guest VLANs because the guest VMs do not get
      their own VLANs provisioned on their network interfaces in a Basic
      zone.

-  An Ethernet port profile configured on the Nexus 1000v virtual switch
   should not use in its set of system VLANs, or any of the VLANs
   configured or intended to be configured for use towards VMs or VM
   resources in the CloudStack environment.

-  You do not have to create any vEthernet port profiles – CloudStack
   does that during VM deployment.

-  Ensure that you create required port profiles to be used by
   CloudStack for different traffic types of CloudStack, such as
   Management traffic, Guest traffic, Storage traffic, and Public
   traffic. The physical networks configured during zone creation should
   have a one-to-one relation with the Ethernet port profiles.

|vmwarenexusportprofile.png: vSphere client|

For information on creating a port profile, see `Cisco Nexus 1000V Port
Profile Configuration Guide 
<http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus1000/sw/4_2_1_s_v_1_4_a/port_profile/configuration/guide/n1000v_port_profile.html>`_.


Assigning Physical NIC Adapters
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Assign ESXi host's physical NIC adapters, which correspond to each
physical network, to the port profiles. In each ESXi host that is part
of the vCenter cluster, observe the physical networks assigned to each
port profile and note down the names of the port profile for future use.
This mapping information helps you when configuring physical networks
during the zone configuration on CloudStack. These Ethernet port profile
names are later specified as VMware Traffic Labels for different traffic
types when configuring physical networks during the zone configuration.
For more information on configuring physical networks, see
:ref:`configuring-a-vsphere-cluster-with-nexus-1000v-virtual-switch`.


Adding VLAN Ranges
''''''''''''''''''

Determine the public VLAN, System VLAN, and Guest VLANs to be used by
the CloudStack. Ensure that you add them to the port profile database.
Corresponding to each physical network, add the VLAN range to port
profiles. In the VSM command prompt, run the switchport trunk allowed
vlan<range> command to add the VLAN ranges to the port profile.

For example:

.. parsed-literal::

   switchport trunk allowed vlan 1,140-147,196-203

In this example, the allowed VLANs added are 1, 140-147, and 196-203

You must also add all the public and private VLANs or VLAN ranges to the
switch. This range is the VLAN range you specify in your zone.

.. note::
   Before you run the vlan command, ensure that the configuration mode is 
   enabled in Nexus 1000v virtual switch.

For example:

If you want the VLAN 200 to be used on the switch, run the following
command:

.. parsed-literal::

   vlan 200

If you want the VLAN range 1350-1750 to be used on the switch, run the
following command:

.. parsed-literal::

   vlan 1350-1750

Refer to Cisco Nexus 1000V Command Reference of specific product
version.


Enabling Nexus Virtual Switch in CloudStack
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To make a CloudStack deployment Nexus enabled, you must set the
vmware.use.nexus.vswitch parameter true by using the Global Settings
page in the CloudStack UI. Unless this parameter is set to "true" and
restart the management server, you cannot see any UI options specific to
Nexus virtual switch, and CloudStack ignores the Nexus virtual switch
specific parameters specified in the AddTrafficTypeCmd,
UpdateTrafficTypeCmd, and AddClusterCmd API calls.

Unless the CloudStack global parameter "vmware.use.nexus.vswitch" is set
to "true", CloudStack by default uses VMware standard vSwitch for
virtual network infrastructure. In this release, CloudStack doesn’t
support configuring virtual networks in a deployment with a mix of
standard vSwitch and Nexus 1000v virtual switch. The deployment can have
either standard vSwitch or Nexus 1000v virtual switch.


Configuring Nexus 1000v Virtual Switch in CloudStack
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can configure Nexus dvSwitch by adding the necessary resources while
the zone is being created.

|vmwarenexusaddcluster.png: vmware nexus add cluster|

After the zone is created, if you want to create an additional cluster
along with Nexus 1000v virtual switch in the existing zone, use the Add
Cluster option. For information on creating a cluster, see

Configuring a VMware Datacenter with VMware Distributed Virtual Switch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CloudStack supports VMware vNetwork Distributed Switch (VDS) for virtual
network configuration in a VMware vSphere environment. This section
helps you configure VMware VDS in a CloudStack deployment. Each vCenter
server instance can support up to 128 VDS instances and each VDS
instance can manage up to 500 VMware hosts.


About VMware Distributed Virtual Switch
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

VMware VDS is an aggregation of host-level virtual switches on a VMware
vCenter server. VDS abstracts the configuration of individual virtual
switches that span across a large number of hosts, and enables
centralized provisioning, administration, and monitoring for your entire
datacenter from a centralized interface. In effect, a VDS acts as a
single virtual switch at the datacenter level and manages networking for
a number of hosts in a datacenter from a centralized VMware vCenter
server. Each VDS maintains network runtime state for VMs as they move
across multiple hosts, enabling inline monitoring and centralized
firewall services. A VDS can be deployed with or without Virtual
Standard Switch and a Nexus 1000V virtual switch.


Prerequisites and Guidelines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  VMware VDS is supported only on Public and Guest traffic in
   CloudStack.

-  VMware VDS does not support multiple VDS per traffic type. If a user
   has many VDS switches, only one can be used for Guest traffic and
   another one for Public traffic.

-  Additional switches of any type can be added for each cluster in the
   same zone. While adding the clusters with different switch type,
   traffic labels is overridden at the cluster level.

-  Management and Storage network does not support VDS. Therefore, use
   Standard Switch for these networks.

-  When you remove a guest network, the corresponding dvportgroup will
   not be removed on the vCenter. You must manually delete them on the
   vCenter.


Preparation Checklist
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For a smoother configuration of VMware VDS, note down the VDS name you
have added in the datacenter before you start:

|vds-name.png: Name of the dvSwitch as specified in the vCenter.|

Use this VDS name in the following:

-  The switch name in the Edit traffic label dialog while configuring a
   public and guest traffic during zone creation.

   During a zone creation, ensure that you select VMware vNetwork
   Distributed Virtual Switch when you configure guest and public
   traffic type.

   |traffic-type.png|

-  The Public Traffic vSwitch Type field when you add a VMware
   VDS-enabled cluster.

-  The switch name in the traffic label while updating the switch type
   in a zone.

Traffic label format in the last case is 
[["Name of vSwitch/dvSwitch/EthernetPortProfile"][,"VLAN ID"[,"vSwitch Type"]]]

The possible values for traffic labels are:

-  empty string

-  dvSwitch0

-  dvSwitch0,200

-  dvSwitch1,300,vmwaredvs

-  myEthernetPortProfile,,nexusdvs

-  dvSwitch0,,vmwaredvs


The three fields to fill in are:

-  Name of the virtual / distributed virtual switch at vCenter.

   The default value depends on the type of virtual switch:

   **vSwitch0**: If type of virtual switch is VMware vNetwork Standard virtual 
   switch

   **dvSwitch0**: If type of virtual switch is VMware vNetwork Distributed 
   virtual switch

   **epp0**: If type of virtual switch is Cisco Nexus 1000v Distributed 
   virtual switch

-  VLAN ID to be used for this traffic wherever applicable.

   This field would be used for only public traffic as of now. In case of 
   guest traffic this field would be ignored and could be left empty for guest 
   traffic. By default empty string would be assumed which translates to 
   untagged VLAN for that specific traffic type.

-  Type of virtual switch. Specified as string.

   Possible valid values are vmwaredvs, vmwaresvs, nexusdvs.

   **vmwaresvs**: Represents VMware vNetwork Standard virtual switch

   **vmwaredvs**: Represents VMware vNetwork distributed virtual switch

   **nexusdvs**: Represents Cisco Nexus 1000v distributed virtual switch.

   If nothing specified (left empty), zone-level default virtual switchwould 
   be defaulted, based on the value of global parameter you specify.

   Following are the global configuration parameters:

   **vmware.use.dvswitch**: Set to true to enable any kind (VMware DVS and 
   Cisco Nexus 1000v) of distributed virtual switch in a CloudStack 
   deployment. If set to false, the virtual switch that can be used in that 
   CloudStack deployment is Standard virtual switch.

   **vmware.use.nexus.vswitch**: This parameter is ignored if 
   vmware.use.dvswitch is set to false. Set to true to enable Cisco Nexus 
   1000v distributed virtual switch in a CloudStack deployment.


Enabling Virtual Distributed Switch in CloudStack
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To make a CloudStack deployment VDS enabled, set the vmware.use.dvswitch
parameter to true by using the Global Settings page in the CloudStack UI
and restart the Management Server. Unless you enable the
vmware.use.dvswitch parameter, you cannot see any UI options specific to
VDS, and CloudStack ignores the VDS-specific parameters that you
specify. Additionally, CloudStack uses VDS for virtual network
infrastructure if the value of vmware.use.dvswitch parameter is true and
the value of vmware.use.nexus.dvswitch parameter is false. Another
global parameter that defines VDS configuration is
vmware.ports.per.dvportgroup. This is the default number of ports per
VMware dvPortGroup in a VMware environment. Default value is 256. This
number directly associated with the number of guest network you can
create.

CloudStack supports orchestration of virtual networks in a deployment
with a mix of Virtual Distributed Switch, Standard Virtual Switch and
Nexus 1000v Virtual Switch.


Configuring Distributed Virtual Switch in CloudStack
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can configure VDS by adding the necessary resources while a zone is
created.

Alternatively, at the cluster level, you can create an additional
cluster with VDS enabled in the existing zone. Use the Add Cluster
option. For information as given in :ref:`adding-a-cluster`.

In both these cases, you must specify the following parameters to
configure VDS:

Storage Preparation for vSphere (iSCSI only)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use of iSCSI requires preparatory work in vCenter. You must add an iSCSI
target and create an iSCSI datastore.

If you are using NFS, skip this section.


Enable iSCSI initiator for ESXi hosts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. In vCenter, go to hosts and Clusters/Configuration, and click Storage
   Adapters link. You will see:

   |vmwareiscsiinitiator.png: iscsi initiator|

#. Select iSCSI software adapter and click Properties.

   |vmwareiscsiinitiatorproperties.png: iscsi initiator properties|

#. Click the Configure... button.

   |vmwareiscsigeneral.png: iscsi general|

#. Check Enabled to enable the initiator.

#. Click OK to save.


Add iSCSI target
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Under the properties dialog, add the iSCSI target info:

|vmwareiscsitargetadd.png: iscsi target add|
   
Repeat these steps for all ESXi hosts in the cluster.


Create an iSCSI datastore
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You should now create a VMFS datastore. Follow these steps to do so:

#. Select Home/Inventory/Datastores.

#. Right click on the datacenter node.

#. Choose Add Datastore... command.

#. Follow the wizard to create a iSCSI datastore.

This procedure should be done on one host in the cluster. It is not
necessary to do this on all hosts.

|vmwareiscsidatastore.png: iscsi datastore|


Multipathing for vSphere (Optional)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Storage multipathing on vSphere nodes may be done according to the
vSphere installation guide.


Add Hosts or Configure Clusters (vSphere)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use vCenter to create a vCenter cluster and add your desired hosts to
the cluster. You will later add the entire cluster to CloudStack. (see
:ref:`adding-a-cluster`).


Applying Hotfixes to a VMware vSphere Host
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Disconnect the VMware vSphere cluster from CloudStack. It should
   remain disconnected long enough to apply the hotfix on the host.

   #. Log in to the CloudStack UI as root.

      See :ref:`log-in-to-ui`

   #. Navigate to the VMware cluster, click Actions, and select
      Unmanage.

   #. Watch the cluster status until it shows Unmanaged.

#. Perform the following on each of the ESXi hosts in the cluster:

   #. Move each of the ESXi hosts in the cluster to maintenance mode.

   #. Ensure that all the VMs are migrated to other hosts in that
      cluster.

   #. If there is only one host in that cluster, shutdown all the VMs
      and move the host into maintenance mode.

   #. Apply the patch on the ESXi host.

   #. Restart the host if prompted.

   #. Cancel the maintenance mode on the host.

#. Reconnect the cluster to CloudStack:

   #. Log in to the CloudStack UI as root.

   #. Navigate to the VMware cluster, click Actions, and select Manage.

   #. Watch the status to see that all the hosts come up. It might take
      several minutes for the hosts to come up.

      Alternatively, verify the host state is properly synchronized and
      updated in the CloudStack database.
