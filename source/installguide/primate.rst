Primate Guide
=============

What is Primate?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Apache CloudStack Primate is a modern role-based progressive UI based on Vue.js
and Ant Design for Apache CloudStack.

Primate GA was released with CloudStack 4.15, where the legacy UI is deprecated,
and will be removed in an eventual major CloudStack release.

`User participation in the community mailing lists
<http://cloudstack.apache.org/mailing-lists.html>`_ is encouraged. Users may
also log issues on Github https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-primate/issues

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Primate uses API auto-discovery to discover APIs allowed for a logged-in user
and creates navigation and views based on that, and requires the following:

- Apache CloudStack 4.15 or later
- API discovery (listApis) enabled
- Modern browsers that are `ES5-compliant <https://github.com/vuejs/vue#browser-compatibility>`_

In theory Primate can work with any older version of CloudStack that supports
API discovery. However, several Primate list views require API pagination support,
some of which are available starting Apache CloudStack 4.15 as well as several other
API improvements which may not be available prior to Apache CloudStack 4.15.

Installation on CentOS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users running management server (4.15 or above) on CentOS can setup the
following Primate repository:

.. parsed-literal::

    rpm --import https://download.cloudstack.org/primate/release.asc
    cat << EOF > /etc/yum.repos.d/cloudstack-primate.repo
    [cloudstack-primate]
    name=cloudstack
    baseurl=https://download.cloudstack.org/primate/centos/
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=1
    gpgkey=https://download.cloudstack.org/primate/release.asc
    EOF

Next, install Primate:

.. parsed-literal::

    yum install cloudstack-primate

Note: there is no need to restart management server post-installation, and
after installation the UI can be accessed on
management-server-host:8080/client/primate using any modern browser.

Installation on Ubuntu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users running CloudStack management server (4.15 or above) on Ubuntu can setup the following Primate repository:

.. parsed-literal::

    apt-key adv --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys BDF0E176584DF93F
    echo deb https://download.cloudstack.org/primate/debian / > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cloudstack-primate.list

Next, install Primate:

.. parsed-literal::

    apt-get update
    apt-get install cloudstack-primate

Note: there is no need to restart management server post-installation, and
after installation the UI can be accessed on
management-server-host:8080/client/primate using any modern browser.

Using Archive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Primate archives are tarballs of single-page app builds. They can be simply
downloaded and extracted to the management server webapp directory or hosted
with a custom webserver.

Users can download the builds from https://download.cloudstack.org/primate/archive/

Using Docker
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users can use docker builds of Primate from https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/cloudstack-primate

For example:

.. parsed-literal::

    docker pull apache/cloudstack-primate:latest
    docker run -ti --rm -p 8080:80 -v $(pwd)/nginx:/etc/nginx/conf.d:ro apache/cloudstack-primate:latest

Example nginx config:

.. parsed-literal::

    server {
        listen       80;
        server_name  localhost;
        location / {
            root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
            index  index.html;
        }
        location /client/ {
            # http://127.0.0.1:8080 should be replaced your CloudStack management
            # Server's actual URI
            proxy_pass   http://127.0.0.1:8080;
        }
    }

Basic Customization in CloudStack Primate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Users can now customize the CloudStack's user interface by means of a configuration file at /usr/share/cloudstack-management/webapp/primate/config.json which can be used to modify the theme, logos, etc. to align to one's requirement.

To change the logo, login banner, error page icon, etc. the following details can be edited in config.json:

.. parsed-literal::

    "logo": "assets/logo.svg",
    "banner": "assets/banner.svg",
    "error": {
        "404": "assets/404.png",
        "403": "assets/403.png",
        "500": "assets/500.png"
    }

where,

- logo: changes the logo top-left side image.
- banner: changes the login banner image.
- error.404: changes the image of error Page not found.
- error.403: changes the image of error Forbidden.
- error.500: changes the image of error Internal Server Error.

Customization of themes is also possible, such as, modifying banner width, general color, etc. This can be done by editing the "theme" section of the config.json file:

.. parsed-literal::

    "theme": {
        "@logo-background-color": "#ffffff",
        "@project-nav-text-color": "#001529",
        "@navigation-text-color": "rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.65)",
        "@navigation-background-color": "#ffffff",
        "@navigation-text-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.65)",
        "@primary-color": "#1890ff",
        "@link-color": "#1890ff",
        "@link-hover-color": "#40a9ff",
        "@loading-color": "#1890ff",
        "@processing-color": "#1890ff",
        "@success-color": "#52c41a",
        "@warning-color": "#faad14",
        "@error-color": "#f5222d",
        "@font-size-base": "14px",
        "@heading-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.85)",
        "@text-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.65)",
        "@text-color-secondary": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.45)",
        "@disabled-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25)",
        "@border-color-base": "#d9d9d9",
        "@border-radius-base": "4px",
        "@box-shadow-base": "0 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15)",
        "@logo-width": "256px",
        "@logo-height": "64px",
        "@banner-width": "700px",
        "@banner-height": "110px",
        "@error-width": "256px",
        "@error-height": "256px"
    }

where,

Advanced Customisation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Primate advanced customisation is possible only by changing JavaScript based config
files which define rules for sections, names, icons, actions and components and by
building primate from source available on the `cloudstack-primate
<https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-primate>`_
repository. Advanced customisation may require some experience in JavaScript and VueJS,
a development and customisation guide is available `here
<https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-primate/blob/master/docs/development.md>`_.

Known Issues and Missing Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Deployment of a basic zone is not supported. However, existing basic zones will continue to be supported as well as all the actions and views of various resources within the existing basic zone.
- Support for S3 based secondary storage.
- NFS secondary staging storage list/resource view and add/update actions.
- SSL certificate for Guest network LB rule.
- Regions.
