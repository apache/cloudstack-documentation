Limitations
===========

Although the external Instances behave a lot like CloudStack managed
Instances in many ways, there are some limitations. Some of these
limitations are due to the framework itself, while others can be addressed
by adding custom actions in the scripts written for the built-in extensions.

**Some general features/actions not supported at the framework level:**

   - Console access to the external Instances.

   - Data volumes.

   - User Data and Metadata services.

   - SSH key injection.

   - Affinity Groups.

   - Migrate Instance.

   - Host Capacity and Utilization Stats.

   - Add Nics to Instance post deployment.

**Actions which can be implemented using Custom Actions in built-in extensions:**

   - Reinstall Instance.

   - Backup and Restore.

   - Recurring Snapshots.

   - Change Service Offering.

   - Resize Volume.

   - Attach ISO.
