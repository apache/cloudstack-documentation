Troubleshooting Extensions
==========================

Validate the Extension Path
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   - Ensure that the path is correctly defined and accessible on all management servers. The executable must be owned by the `cloud` user and group, and have appropriate permissions to be executed by `cloud:cloud`.

   - The script or binary must be executable and have appropriate permissions.

   - If the binary differs across management servers, the extension will be marked as Not Ready.

   - Ensure files are stored at: `/usr/share/cloudstack-management/extensions/<extension_name>`

   - CloudStack runs a background task at regular intervals to verify path readiness. If the path is not ready, its state will appear as Not Ready in the UI or API responses.

   - Alerts are generated if the extension path is not ready.

   - The check interval can be configured using the global configuration - `extension.path.state.check.interval`. The default is 5 minutes.

Verify Payload Handling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   - Ensure the extension binary can correctly read and parse the incoming JSON payload.

   - Payload files are placed at: `/var/lib/cloudstack/management/extensions/<extension_name>/`

   - These payload files are automatically cleaned up after 24 hours.

   - Improper parsing of the payload is a common cause of failureâ€”log any parsing errors in your extension binary for debugging.

Refer to Base Extension Scripts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   - For guidance on implementing supported actions, refer to the base scripts present for each extension type.

   - For Orchestrator-type extensions, see: `/usr/share/cloudstack-common/scripts/vm/hypervisor/external/provisioner/provisioner.sh`

   - These scripts provide examples of how to handle standard actions like start, stop, status, etc.

Check Logs for Errors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   - If the extension does not respond or returns an error, check the management server logs.

   - Logs include details of:

        1. Invocation of the extension binary

        2. Payload hand-off

        3. Output parsing

   - Any exceptions or exit code issues.
