Basic Zone Physical Network Configuration
-----------------------------------------

.. note::
   Since release of Cloudstack 4.15 "Basic Networking" is deprecated. Instead use
   "Advanced Networking" and create a "Shared Network" as described in this
   documentation.

In a basic network, configuring the physical network is fairly
straightforward. You only need to configure one guest network to carry
traffic that is generated by guest VMs. When you first add a zone to
CloudStack, you set up the guest network through the Add Zone screens.
