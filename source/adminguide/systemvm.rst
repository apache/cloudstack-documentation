CloudStack uses several types of system virtual machines to perform
tasks in the cloud. In general CloudStack manages these system VMs and
creates, starts, and stops them as needed based on scale and immediate
needs. However, the administrator should be aware of them and their
roles to assist in debugging issues.


The System VM Template
----------------------

The System VMs come from a single template. The System VM has the
following characteristics:

-  Debian 10.8(buster), 4.19.0 kernel with the latest security
   patches from the Debian security APT repository

-  Has a minimal set of packages installed thereby reducing the attack
   surface

-  64-bit for enhanced performance on Xen/VMWare

-  pvops kernel with Xen PV drivers, KVM virtio drivers, and VMware
   tools for optimum performance on all hypervisors

-  Xen tools inclusion allows performance monitoring

-  Latest versions of HAProxy, iptables, IPsec, and Apache from debian
   repository ensures improved security and speed

-  Latest version of JRE from Sun/Oracle ensures improved security and
   speed


Changing the Default System VM Template
---------------------------------------

Using the 64-bit template should be use with a System Offering of at least 512MB
of memory.

#. Based on the hypervisor you use, download the 64-bit template from
   the following location:

   .. cssclass:: table-striped table-bordered table-hover

   ==========  ================================================================================================
   Hypervisor  Download Location
   ==========  ================================================================================================
   XenServer   |sysvm64-url-xen|
   KVM         |sysvm64-url-kvm|
   VMware      |sysvm64-url-vmware|
   Hyper-V     |sysvm64-url-hyperv|
   ==========  ================================================================================================

#. As an administrator, log in to the CloudStack UI

#. Register the 64 bit template.

   For example: KVM64bitTemplate

#. While registering the template, select Routing.

#. Navigate to Infrastructure > Zone > Settings.

#. Set the name of the 64-bit template, KVM64bitTemplate, in the
   *``router.template.kvm``* global parameter.

   If you are using a XenServer 64-bit template, set the name in the
   *``router.template.xen``* global parameter.

   Any new virtual router created in this Zone automatically picks up
   this template.

#. Restart the Management Server.

Accessing System VMs
--------------------

It may sometimes be necessary to access System VMs for diagnostics of certain
issues, for example if you are experiencing SSVM (Secondary Storage VM)
connection issues. Use the steps below in order to connect to the SSH console
of a running System VM.

Accessing System VMs over the network requires the use of private keys and
connecting to System VMs SSH Daemon on port 3922. XenServer/KVM Hypervisors
store this key at /root/.ssh/id_rsa.cloud on each CloudStack agent. To access
System VMs running on ESXi, the key is stored on the management server at
/var/lib/cloudstack/management/.ssh/id_rsa.


#. Find the details of the System VM

   #. Log in with admin privileges to the CloudStack UI.

   #. Click Infrastructure, then System VMs, and then click the name of a
      running VM.

   #. Take a note of the 'Host', 'Private IP Address' and 'Link Local IP
      Address' of the System VM you wish to access.

#. XenServer/KVM Hypervisors

   #. Connect to the Host of which the System VM is running.

   #. SSH to the 'Link Local IP Address' of the System VM from the Host on
      which the VM is running.

      Format: ssh -i <path-to-private-key> <link-local-ip> -p 3922

      Example: root@kvm01:~# ssh -i /root/.ssh/id_rsa.cloud 169.254.3.93 -p 3922

#. ESXi Hypervisors

   #. Connect to your CloudStack Management Server.

   #. ESXi users should SSH to the private IP address of the System VM.

      Format: ssh -i <path-to-private-key> <vm-private-ip> -p 3922

      Example: root@management:~# ssh -i /var/lib/cloudstack/management/.ssh/id_rsa 172.16.0.250 -p 3922

Multiple System VM Support for VMware
-------------------------------------

Every CloudStack zone has single System VM for template processing tasks
such as downloading templates, uploading templates, and uploading ISOs.
In a zone where VMware is being used, additional System VMs can be
launched to process VMware-specific tasks such as taking snapshots and
creating private templates. The CloudStack management server launches
additional System VMs for VMware-specific tasks as the load increases.
The management server monitors and weights all commands sent to these
System VMs and performs dynamic load balancing and scaling-up of more
System VMs.


Console Proxy
-------------

The Console Proxy is a type of System Virtual Machine that has a role in
presenting a console view via the web UI. It connects the user’s browser
to the VNC port made available via the hypervisor for the console of the
guest. Both the administrator and end user web UIs offer a console
connection.

Clicking a console icon brings up a new window. The console viewer
into that window refers to the public IP address of a console proxy VM.
There is exactly one public IP address allocated per console proxy VM.
The viewer application connects to this IP. The console proxy then proxies
the connection to the VNC port for the requested VM on the Host hosting
the guest.

Since 4.15, noVNC has been integrated into the console proxy and is the
default viewer. It inherently supports multiple keyboard layouts configured
in the guest virtual machine. Additionally, it can scale the display as
well as paste into the console.

noVNC is set as the default console viewer which be changed via the
"novnc.console.default" global setting, which is set to true by default.

.. note::
   The hypervisors will have many ports assigned to VNC usage so that
   multiple VNC sessions can occur simultaneously.

There is never any traffic to the guest virtual IP, and there is no need
to enable VNC within the guest.

The console proxy VM will periodically report its active session count
to the Management Server. The default reporting interval is five
seconds. This can be changed through standard Management Server
configuration with the parameter consoleproxy.loadscan.interval.

Assignment of guest VM to console proxy is determined by first
determining if the guest VM has a previous session associated with a
console proxy. If it does, the Management Server will assign the guest
VM to the target Console Proxy VM regardless of the load on the proxy
VM. Failing that, the first available running Console Proxy VM that has
the capacity to handle new sessions is used.

Console proxies can be restarted by administrators but this will
interrupt existing console sessions for users.

Creating a VM Console Endpointy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The access to a VM Console is created by the API 'createConsoleEndpoint', 
for the VM specified in the parameter 'virtualmachineid'. By default, 
the CloudStack UI connects to the URL that this API generates.

The response of the 'createConsoleEndpoint' API also contain the information 
to create a websocket session to the VNC server on the console proxy, this 
infomation includes: the host, port, path and token parameters required to 
establish a websocket session, bypassing the VNC client on the console proxy.

It is possible to add extra validation for the console proxy authentication, 
with the following configurations:

- ‘consoleproxy.extra.security.validation.enabled’: Enable/disable extra security 
  validation for console proxy using a token

When ‘consoleproxy.extra.security.validation.enabled’ is true: then CloudStack 
requests the ‘token’ parameter to the ‘createConsoleEndpoint’ API. The console URL 
retrieved on the API response includes an ‘extra’ parameter for users validation on 
the console proxy. 

When the console proxy receives a request including the ‘extra’ parameter it 
will decode the ‘token’ parameter and uses the original token to compare it with 
the ‘extra’ token. Only in case both matches, then the console access is allowed. 
   
When ‘consoleproxy.extra.security.validation.enabled’ is false: then CloudStack 
does not require a token for validation.

The websocket port is passed as a boot argument to the console proxy and the 
management server decides between the secure or unsecure port (8443 or 8080) when 
setting the boot arguments for the CPVM.

- The secure port 8443 is sent as a boot argument when:

   - The setting ‘consoleproxy.sslEnabled’ is true
   
   - The setting ‘consoleproxy.url.domain’ is not empty
   
   - There is a record on the ‘keystore’ database with name ‘CPVMCertificate’

- In any other case, then the port 8080 is selected


Administrators must ensure a new console proxy VM is recreated after changing 
the value of any of the settings. Once the console proxy VM is recreated, 
the new VNC server port will be used as the websocket traffic port. The console proxy 
VM startup will also ensure a new iptable rule is added for the new VNC port, 
allowing the traffic on it.


Using a SSL Certificate for the Console Proxy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the console viewing functionality uses plaintext HTTP. In
any production environment, the console proxy connection should be
encrypted via SSL at the minimum.

A CloudStack administrator has 2 ways to secure the console proxy
communication with SSL:

-  Set up a SSL wild-card certificate and domain name resolution

-  Set up SSL certificate for specific FQDN and configure load-balancer


Changing the Console Proxy SSL Certificate and Domain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The administrator can configure SSL encryption  by selecting a domain
and uploading a new SSL certificate and private key. The domain must
run a DNS service that is capable of resolving queries for addresses
of the form aaa-bbb-ccc-ddd.your.domain to an IPv4 IP address in the
form aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd, for example, 202.8.44.1. To change the console
proxy domain, SSL certificate, and private key:

#. Set up dynamic name resolution or populate all possible DNS names in
   your public IP range into your existing DNS server with the format
   aaa-bbb-ccc-ddd.consoleproxy.company.com -> aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd.

   .. note::
      In these steps you will notice *consoleproxy.company.com* -For
      security best practices, we recommend creating a wildcard SSL
      certificate on a separate subdomain so in the event that the
      certificate is compromised, a malicious user cannot impersonate
      a company.com domain.

#. Generate the private key and certificate signing request (CSR). When
   you are using openssl to generate private/public key pairs and CSRs,
   for the private key that you are going to paste into the CloudStack
   UI, be sure to convert it into PKCS#8 format.

   #. Generate a new 2048-bit private key

      .. code:: bash

         openssl genrsa -des3 -out yourprivate.key 2048

   #. Generate a new certificate CSR. Ensure the creation of a wildcard
      certificate, eg ``*.consoleproxy.company.com``

      .. code:: bash

         openssl req -new -key yourprivate.key -out yourcertificate.csr

   #. Head to the website of your favourite trusted Certificate
      Authority, purchase an SSL certificate, and submit the CSR. You
      should receive a valid certificate in return

   #. Convert your private key format into PKCS#8 encrypted format.

      .. code:: bash

         openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -in yourprivate.key -out yourprivate.pkcs8.encrypted.key

   #. Convert your PKCS#8 encrypted private key into the PKCS#8 format
      that is compliant with CloudStack

      .. code:: bash

         openssl pkcs8 -in yourprivate.pkcs8.encrypted.key -out yourprivate.pkcs8.key

#. In the Update SSL Certificate screen of the CloudStack UI, paste the
   following:

   -  The certificate you've just generated.

   -  The private key you've just generated.

   -  The desired domain name, prefixed with ``*.``; for example, ``*.consoleproxy.company.com``

     |update-ssl.png|

#. This stops all currently running console proxy VMs, then restarts
   them with the new certificate and key. Users might notice a brief
   interruption in console availability.

The Management Server generates URLs of the form
"aaa-bbb-ccc-ddd.consoleproxy.company.com" after this change is made.
The new console requests will be served with the new DNS domain name,
certificate, and key.

Uploading ROOT CA and Intermediate CA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you need to upload custom certificate with ROOT CA and intermediate CA, you can find more details here:
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/Procedure+to+Replace+realhostip.com+with+Your+Own+Domain+Name

IMPORTANT NOTES:

In order to avoid errors and problems while uploading custom certificates, please check following:

1. While doing URL encoding of ROOT CA and any Intermediate CA, be sure that the plus signs ("+") inside certificates
are not replaced by space (" "), because some URL/string encoding tools tend to do that.

2. If you are renewing certificates it might happen you need to upload new ROOT CA and Intermediate CA, together with new Server Certificate and key.
In this case please be sure to use same names for certificates during API upload of certificate, example:

http://123.123.123.123:8080/client/api?command=uploadCustomCertificate&...&name=root1...
http://123.123.123.123:8080/client/api?command=uploadCustomCertificate&...&name=intermed1...

Here names are "root1" and "intermed1".
If you used other names previously, please check the cloud.keystore table to obtain used names.

If you still have problems and folowing errors in management.log while destroying CPVM:

- Unable to build keystore for CPVMCertificate due to CertificateException
- Cold not find and construct a valid SSL certificate

that means that still some of the Root/intermediate/server certificates or the key is not in a good format, or incorrectly encoded or multiply Root CA/Intermediate CA present in database by mistake.

Other way to renew Certificates (Root,Intermediates,Server certificates and key) - although not recommended
unless you fill comfortable - is to directly edit the database,
while still respect the main requirement that the private key is PKCS8 encoded, while Root CA, Intermediate and Server certificates
are still in default PEM format (no URL encoding needed here).
After editing the database, please restart management server, and destroy SSVM and CPVM after that,
so the new SSVM and CPVM with new certificates are created.

Load-balancing Console Proxies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An alternative to using dynamic DNS or creating a range of DNS entries
as described in the last section would be to create a SSL certificate
for a specific domain name, configure CloudStack to use that particular
FQDN, and then configure a load balancer to load balance the console
proxy's IP address behind the FQDN. As the functionality for this is
still new, please see
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/Realhost+IP+changes
for more details.


Virtual Router
--------------

The virtual router is a type of System Virtual Machine. The virtual
router is one of the most frequently used service providers in
CloudStack. The end user has no direct access to the virtual router.
Users can ping the virtual router and take actions that affect it (such
as setting up port forwarding), but users do not have SSH access into
the virtual router.

There is no mechanism for the administrator to log in to the virtual
router. Virtual routers can be restarted by administrators, but this
will interrupt public network access and other services for end users. A
basic test in debugging networking issues is to attempt to ping the
virtual router from a guest VM. Some of the characteristics of the
virtual router are determined by its associated system service offering.


Configuring the Virtual Router
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can set the following:

-  IP range

-  Supported network services

-  Default domain name for the network serviced by the virtual router

-  Gateway IP address

-  How often CloudStack fetches network usage statistics from CloudStack
   virtual routers. If you want to collect traffic metering data from
   the virtual router, set the global configuration parameter
   router.stats.interval. If you are not using the virtual router to
   gather network usage statistics, set it to 0.


Upgrading a Virtual Router with System Service Offerings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When CloudStack creates a virtual router, it uses default settings which
are defined in a default system service offering. See `“System Service
Offerings” <#system-service-offerings>`_. All the
virtual routers in a single guest network use the same system service
offering. You can upgrade the capabilities of the virtual router by
creating and applying a custom system service offering.

#. Define your custom system service offering.
   See `“Creating a New System Service Offering”
   <#creating-a-new-system-service-offering>`_.
   In System VM Type, choose Domain Router.

#. Associate the system service offering with a network offering. See
   `“Creating a New Network Offering”
   <networking.html#creating-a-new-network-offering>`_.

#. Apply the network offering to the network where you want the virtual
   routers to use the new system service offering. If this is a new
   network, follow the steps in Adding an Additional Guest Network on
   page 66. To change the service offering for existing virtual routers,
   follow the steps in `“Changing the Network Offering on a Guest Network”
   <advanced_zone_config.html#changing-the-network-offering-on-a-guest-network>`_.


Best Practices for Virtual Routers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  WARNING: Restarting a virtual router from a hypervisor console
   deletes all the iptables rules. To work around this issue, stop the
   virtual router and start it from the CloudStack UI.

-  .. warning::
      Do not use the destroyRouter API when only one router is available
      in the network, because restartNetwork API with the cleanup=false
      parameter can't recreate it later. If you want to destroy and
      recreate the single router available in the network, use the
      restartNetwork API with the cleanup=true parameter.


Service Monitoring Tool for Virtual Router
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Various services running on the CloudStack virtual routers can be
monitored by using a Service Monitoring tool. The tool ensures that
services are successfully running until CloudStack deliberately disables
them. If a service goes down, the tool automatically attempts to restart
service, and if that does not help bringing up the service, an alert as
well as an event is generated indicating the failure. A new global
parameter, ``network.router.enableservicemonitoring``, has been
introduced to control this feature. The default value is false, implies,
monitoring is disabled. When you enable, ensure that the Management
Server and the router are restarted.

Monitoring tool can help to start a VR service, which is crashed due to
an unexpected reason. For example:

-  The services crashed due to defects in the source code.

-  The services that are terminated by the OS when memory or CPU is not
   sufficiently available for the service.

.. note::
   Only those services with daemons are monitored. The services that are
   failed due to errors in the service/daemon configuration file cannot
   be restarted by the Monitoring tool. VPC Networks are supported (as of CloudStack 4.14)

The following services are monitored in a VR:

-  DNS (dnsmasq)

-  HAProxy (haproxy)

-  SSH (sshd)

-  Apache Web Server (apache2)

The following networks are supported:

-  Isolated Networks

-  Shared Networks in both Advanced and Basic zone

-  VPC (as of CloudStack 4.14)

This feature is supported on the following hypervisors: XenServer,
VMware, and KVM.

Log file /var/log/routerServiceMonitor.log contains the actions undertaken/attempted
by the service monitoring script (i.e. trying to restart a stopped service).

As of CloudStack 4.14, the interval at which the service monitoring script runs
is no more hardcoded to 3 minutes, but is instead controlled via
global setting router.health.checks.basic.interval.


Health checks for Virtual Router
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to monitoring services as of 4.14 CloudStack adds a framework
for more extensive health checks. The health checks are split into two
categories - basic and advanced. The two categories have their own admin
definable intervals. The split is made this way as the advanced health checks
are considerably more expensive. The health checks will be available on-demand
via API as well as scheduled.

The following tests are covered: · Basic connectivity from the management server
to the virtual router

-  Basic connectivity to virtual router its interfaces' gateways

-  Free disk space on virtual router's disk

-  CPU and memory usage

-  Basic VR Sanity checks:

    #.  Ssh/dnsmasq/haproxy/httpd service running

-  Advanced VR Sanity checks:

    #.  DHCP/DNS configuration matches mgmt server DB

    #.  IPtables rules match management server records

    #.  HAproxy config matches mgmt server DB records

    #.  VR Version against current version


This happens in the following steps:

1. Management server periodically pushes data to each running virtual router
including schedule intervals, tests to skip, some configuration for LB, VMs,
Gateways, etc.

2. Basic and advanced tests as scheduled as per the intervals in the data sent
by Management server. Each run of checks populates it’s results and saves it
within the router at ‘/root/basic_monitor_results.json’ and
'/root/advance_monitor_results.json’. Each run of checks also keeps
track of the start time, end time, and duration of test run for better
understanding.

3. Each test is also available on demand via ' getRouterHealthCheckResults'
API added with the patch. The API can be executed from CLI and UI. Performing
fresh checks is expensive and will cause management server doing the following:

   a. Refresh the data from Management server records on the router for
   verification (repeat of step 1),

   b. Run all the checks of both basic and advanced type,

   c. Fetch the result of the health check from router to be sent back in response.

4. The patch also supports custom health checks with custom systemVM templates.
This is achieved as follows:

   a. Each executable script placed in '/root/health_scripts/' is considered an
   independent health check and is executed on each scheduled or on demand health check run.

   b. The health check script can be in any language but executable (use 'chmod a+x')
   within '/root/health_checks/' directory. The placed script must do the following:

      #. Accept a command line parameter for check type (basic or advanced) - this
      parameter is sent by the internal cron job in the VR (/etc/cron.d/process)

      #. Proceed and perform checks as per the check type - basic or advanced

      #. In order to be recognized as a health check and displayed in the list of health
      checks results, it must print some message to STDOUT which is passed back as message
      to management server - if the script doesn’t return anything on its STDOUT, it
      will not be registered as a health check/displayed in the list of the health check results

      #. exit with status of 0 if check was successful and exit with status of 1 if
      check has failed

      .. code:: bash

         #!/bin/bash if [$1 == ‘advanced’] { do advance checks and print any message to STDOUT }
         else if [$1 == ‘basic’] { do basic checks and print any message to STDOUT } exit(0) if pass or exit(1) if failure

      #. i.e. if the script is intended to be i.e. a basic check, it must checks
      for the presence of the 'basic' as the first parameter sent to it, and execute the
      wanted commands and print some output to STDOUT; otherwise if it receives 'advanced'
      as the first parameter, it should not execute any commands/logic nor print anything to STDOUT

5. There are 9 health check scripts written in default systemvm template in '/root/health_checks/'
folder. These indicate the health checks described in executive summary.

6. The management server will connect periodically to each virtual router to confirm that the
checks are running as scheduled, and retrieve the results of those checks. Any failing checks
present in ``router.health.checks.failures.to.restart.vr`` will cause the VR to be recreated.
On each check management server will persist only the last executed check results in its database.

7. UI parses the returned health check results and shows the router 'Health Check'
column in 'Failed'/'Passed' if there are health check failures of any type.

Following global configs have been added for configuring health checks:

   - ``router.health.checks.enabled`` - If true, router health checks are allowed
   to be executed and read. If false, all scheduled checks and API calls for on
   demand checks are disabled. Default is true.

   - ``router.health.checks.basic.interval`` - Interval in minutes at which basic
   router health checks are performed. If set to 0, no tests are scheduled. Default
   is 3 mins as per the pre 4.14 monitor services.

   - ``router.health.checks.advanced.interval`` - Interval in minutes at which
   advanced router health checks are performed. If set to 0, no tests are scheduled.
   Default value is 10 minutes.

   - ``router.health.checks.config.refresh.interval`` - Interval in minutes at which
   router health checks config - such as scheduling intervals, excluded checks, etc
   is updated on virtual routers by the management server. This value should be
   sufficiently high (like 2x) from the router.health.checks.basic.interval and
   router.health.checks.advanced.interval so that there is time between new results
   generation for passed data. Default is 10 mins.

   - ``router.health.checks.results.fetch.interval`` - Interval in minutes at which
   router health checks results are fetched by management server. On each result fetch,
   management server evaluates need to recreate VR as per configuration of
   'router.health.checks.failures.to.recreate.vr'. This value should be sufficiently
   high (like 2x) from the 'router.health.checks.basic.interval' and
   'router.health.checks.advanced.interval' so that there is time between new
   results generation and fetch.

   - ``router.health.checks.failures.to.recreate.vr`` - Health checks failures defined
   by this config are the checks that should cause router recreation. If empty the
   recreate is not attempted for any health check failure. Possible values are comma
   separated script names from systemvm’s /root/health_scripts/ (namely - cpu_usage_check.py,
   dhcp_check.py, disk_space_check.py, dns_check.py, gateways_check.py, haproxy_check.py,
   iptables_check.py, memory_usage_check.py, router_version_check.py), connectivity.test
   or services (namely - loadbalancing.service, webserver.service, dhcp.service)

   - ``router.health.checks.to.exclude`` - Health checks that should be excluded when
   executing scheduled checks on the router. This can be a comma separated list of
   script names placed in the '/root/health_checks/' folder. Currently the following
   scripts are placed in default systemvm template - cpu_usage_check.py,
   disk_space_check.py, gateways_check.py, iptables_check.py, router_version_check.py,
   dhcp_check.py, dns_check.py, haproxy_check.py, memory_usage_check.py.

   - ``router.health.checks.free.disk.space.threshold`` - Free disk space threshold
   (in MB) on VR below which the check is considered a failure. Default is 100MB.

   - ``router.health.checks.max.cpu.usage.threshold`` - Max CPU Usage threshold as
   % above which check is considered a failure.

   - ``router.health.checks.max.memory.usage.threshold`` - Max Memory Usage threshold
   as % above which check is considered a failure.

The scripts for following health checks are provided in '/root/health_checks/'. These
are not exhaustive and can be modified for covering other scenarios not covered.
Details of individual checks:

1. Basic checks:

   a. Services check (ssh, dnsmasq, httpd, haproxy)– this check is still done as
   per existing monitorServices.py script and any services not running are attempted
   to be restarted.

   b. Disk space check against a threshold – python's ' statvfs' module is used to
   retrieve statistics and compare with the configured threshold given by
   management server.

   c. CPU usage check against a threshold – we use 'top' utility to retrieve idle
   CPU and compare that with the configured max CPU usage threshold given by management
   server.

   d. Memory usage check against a threshold – we use 'free' utility to get the
   used memory and compare that with the configured max memory usage threshold.

   e. Router template and scripts version check – is done by comparing the contents
   of the '/etc/cloudstack-release' and '/var/cache/cloud/cloud-scripts-signature'
   with the data given by management server.

   f. Connectivity to the gateways from router – this is done by analysing the success
   or failure of ping to the gateway IPs given by management server.

2. Advanced checks:

   a. DNS config match against MS – this is checked by comparing entries of '/etc/hosts'
   on the VR and VM records passed by management server.

   b. DHCP config match against MS – this is checked by comparing entries of
   '/etc/dhcphosts.txt' on the VR with the VM entries passed by management server.

   c. HA Proxy config match against MS (internal LB and public LB) - this is checked
   by verifying the max connections, and entries for each load balancing rule in the
   '/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg' file. We do not check for stickiness properties yet.

   d. Port forwarding match against MS in iptables. - this is checked by verifying
   IPs and ports in the 'iptables-save' command output against an expected list of
   entries from management server.


Enhanced Upgrade for Virtual Routers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Upgrading VR is made flexible. The CloudStack administrators will be
able to control the sequence of the VR upgrades. The sequencing is based
on Infrastructure hierarchy, such as by Cluster, Pod, or Zone, and
Administrative (Account) hierarchy, such as by Tenant or Domain. As an
administrator, you can also determine when a particular customer
service, such as VR, is upgraded within a specified upgrade interval.
Upgrade operation is enhanced to increase the upgrade speed by allowing
as many upgrade operations in parallel as possible.

During the entire duration of the upgrade, users cannot launch new
services or make changes to an existing service.

Additionally, using multiple versions of VRs in a single instance is
supported. In the Details tab of a VR, you can view the version and
whether it requires upgrade. During the Management Server upgrade,
CloudStack checks whether VR is at the latest version before performing
any operation on the VR. To support this, a new global parameter,
*``router.version.check``*, has been added. This parameter is set to
true by default, which implies minimum required version is checked
before performing any operation. No operation is performed if the VR is
not at the required version. Services of the older version VR continue
to be available, but no further operations can be performed on the VR
until it is upgraded to the latest version. This will be a transient
state until the VR is upgraded. This will ensure that the availability
of VR services and VR state is not impacted due to the Management Server
upgrade.

The following service will be available even if the VR is not upgraded.
However, no changes for any of the services can be sent to the VR, until
it is upgraded:

-  SecurityGroup

-  UserData

-  DHCP

-  DNS

-  LB

-  Port Forwarding

-  VPN

-  Static NAT

-  Source NAT

-  Firewall

-  Gateway

-  NetworkACL


Supported Virtual Routers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  VR

-  VPC VR

-  Redundant VR


Upgrading Virtual Routers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Download the latest System VM template.

#. Download the latest System VM to all the primary storage pools.

#. Upgrade the Management Server.

#. Upgrade CPVM and SSVM either from the UI or by using the following
   script:

   .. code:: bash

      # cloudstack-sysvmadm -d <IP address> -u cloud -p -s

   Even when the VRs are still on older versions, existing services will
   continue to be available to the VMs. The Management Server cannot
   perform any operations on the VRs until they are upgraded.

#. Selectively upgrade the VRs:

   #. Log in to the CloudStack UI as the root administrator.

   #. In the left navigation, choose Infrastructure.

   #. On Virtual Routers, click View More.

      All the VRs are listed in the Virtual Routers page.

   #. In Select View drop-down, select desired grouping based on your
      requirement.

      You can use either of the following:

      -  Group by zone

      -  Group by pod

      -  Group by cluster

      -  Group by account

   #. Click the group which has the VRs to be upgraded.

      For example, if you have selected Group by zone, select the name
      of the desired zone.

   #. Click the Upgrade button to upgrade all the VRs. |vr-upgrade.png|

   #. Click OK to confirm.


Secondary Storage VM
--------------------

In addition to the hosts, CloudStack’s Secondary Storage VM mounts and
writes to secondary storage.

Submissions to secondary storage go through the Secondary Storage VM.
The Secondary Storage VM can retrieve templates and ISO images from URLs
using a variety of protocols.

The secondary storage VM provides a background task that takes care of a
variety of secondary storage activities: downloading a new template to a
Zone, copying templates between Zones, and snapshot backups.

The administrator can log in to the secondary storage VM if needed.

Migrating System VMs
--------------------

System VMs (any of the Console Proxy VM, Secondary Storage VM, Virtual Router or Load Balancer) can be migrated across hosts using migrateSysteVm API or migrate action in the UI. These VMs can be migrated between hosts of the same cluster only.

Since CloudStack 4.16, for VMware, migration of System VMs can also be done to a destination host in a different cluster belonging to the same pod (in case of cluster-wide primary storage pools, this will cause the Root volume of the system VM to be migrated to the appropriate datastore in the new cluster). Storage migration of stopped System VMs is also supported.

Troubleshoot networks from System VMs
-------------------------------------
.. |run-diagnostics-icon.png| image:: /_static/images/run-diagnostics-icon.png
.. |get-diagnostics-icon.png| image:: /_static/images/get-diagnostics-icon.png
.. |diagnostics-form.png| image:: /_static/images/diagnostics-form.png
.. |diagnostics-data-form.png| image:: /_static/images/diagnostics-data-form.png

For troubleshooting of network issues in CloudStack hosted networks, CloudStack allows
the administrator to execute network-utility commands (ping, traceroute or arping)
remotely on system VMs.

To run either a ping, traceroute or arping through the CloudStack UI:

#. As an administrator, log in to the CloudStack UI.

#. Navigate to Infrastructure > System VMs or Virtual Routers.

#. Click on the Run Diagnostics button. |run-diagnostics-icon.png|

#. A form will pop up similar to this;
      |diagnostics-form.png|
#. Fill in the details and click OK.

The Extra Args parameter is for specifying command line optional parameters
as one would when executing any of the tools from the terminal or command line.

The supported versions are Debian 10 based since system VMs are built using the
same Debian 10 based templates.

| See:
| Traceroute(1): https://manpages.debian.org/stretch/traceroute/traceroute.1.en.html
| Ping(8): https://manpages.debian.org/stretch/iputils-ping/ping.8.en.html
| Arping(8): https://manpages.debian.org/stretch/arping/arping.8.en.html


Non-Alphanumeric characters (metacharacters) are not allowed for this parameter
except for the “-“ and the “.”. Any metacharacter supplied will immediately result
in an immediate termination of the command and report back to the operator that an illegal character was passed

Get Diagnostics Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For further troubleshooting, a set of files can be retrieved from any system VM
by using the Get Diagnostics feature, either via the UI or an API call. The
files are compressed and a URL is returned where the diagnostics data can be
retrieved.

#. As an administrator, log in to the CloudStack UI.

#. Navigate to Infrastructure > System VMs or Virtual Routers.

#. Click on the Get Diagnostics button. |get-diagnostics-icon.png|

#. A form will pop up similar to this;

      |diagnostics-data-form.png|

#. Click OK.

#. Wait for the URL to generate and click it to download the zipped up
   diagnostics files.

The following files are retrieved by default for the Virtual Router and
is configurable using a global setting: ‘diagnostics.data.router.defaults’

iptables, ipaddr, iproute, /etc/cloudstack-release, /etc/dnsmasq.conf,
/etc/dhcphosts.txt, /etc/dhcpopts.txt, /etc/dnsmasq.d/cloud.conf,
/etc/dnsmasq-resolv.conf, /var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases, /var/log/dnsmasq.log,
/etc/hosts, /etc/resolv.conf, /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg, /var/log/haproxy.log,
/etc/ipsec.d/l2tp.conf, /var/log/cloud.log, /var/log/routerServiceMonitor.log,
/var/log/daemon.log"

The following files are retrieved by default for the Secondary Storage VM 
and Console Proxy VM and is configurable using a global setting: 
‘diagnostics.data.systemvm.defaults’

"iptables, ipaddr, iproute, /etc/cloudstack-release,
/usr/local/cloud/systemvm/conf/agent.properties,
/usr/local/cloud/systemvm/conf/consoleproxy.properties, /var/log/cloud.log,
/var/log/patchsystemvm.log /var/log/daemon.log"

These global settings are all dynamic and do not require a restart of the
management server in order for changes to be effective. The names wrapped in
square brackets are for data types that need to first execute a script in the
system vm and grab output for retrieval, e.g. the output from iptables-save is
written to a file which will then be retrieved. This also allows an admin to
pack their own custom scripts in the system VMs that can be executed and their
output will be redirected to a text file that will be retrieved.

The API also has an optional parameter ‘files’ which can be used for retrieving
specific files. This parameter has to be the absolute path to where the file
exists on the file system.

The output from any command/script can be retrieved by wrapping the name with
square brackets which will be executed and its output redirected to a file with
a name similar to the name in square brackets in lower case. For example, a
user can package their own custom script in the system VM called
myscript.py/sh, the user will then retrieve output of this script by specifying
it as ‘[MYSCRIPT]’ as either input parameter to files or setting it as a global
setting. the API will then execute this script and redirect its output to a
file called ‘myscript.log’. This could also be any command that can be executed
from the shell and its output will be gathered and retrieved.

Additional global settings can be configured related to garbage collection of
generated diagnostics data files and are as follows:

* diagnostics.data.gc.enable

  Enables the garbage collector background task to delete old files. Changing
  this setting requires a management server restart. The default value is True

* diagnostics.data.gc.interval

  The interval at which the garbage collector background tasks in seconds. This
  setting requires a management server restart. The default value is 86400
  (Once a day).

* diagnostics.data.retrieval.timeout

  The overall system VM script execution time out in seconds. This setting does
  not require a management server restart. The default value is 1800.

* diagnostics.data.max.file.age

  Sets the maximum time in seconds a file can stay in storage before it is
  deleted. The default value is 86400 (1 day).

* diagnostics.data.disable.threshold

  Sets the secondary storage disk utilisation percentage for file retrieval.
  An exception is thrown when no secondary store is found with a lower capacity
  than the specified value. The default value is 0.95 (95 %).
