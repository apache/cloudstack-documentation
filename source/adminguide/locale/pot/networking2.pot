Each virtual router in an isolated network has three network interfaces. If multiple public VLAN is used, the router will have multiple public interfaces. Its eth0 interface serves as the gateway for the guest traffic and has the IP address of 10.1.1.1. Its eth1 interface is used by the system to configure the virtual router. Its eth2 interface is assigned a public IP address for public traffic. If multiple public VLAN is used, the router will have multiple public interfaces."

The following is an illustration of how GLSB functionality is provided in CloudStack: An organization, xyztelco, has set up a public cloud that spans two zones, Zone-1 and Zone-2, across geographically separated data centers that are managed by CloudStack. Tenant-A of the cloud launches a highly available solution by using xyztelco cloud. For that purpose, they launch two instances each in both the zones: VM1 and VM2 in Zone-1 and VM5 and VM6 in Zone-2. Tenant-A acquires a public IP, IP-1 in Zone-1, and configures a load balancer rule to load balance the traffic between VM1 and VM2 instances. CloudStack orchestrates setting up a virtual server on the LB service provider in Zone-1. Virtual server 1 that is set up on the LB service provider in Zone-1 represents a publicly accessible virtual server that client reaches at IP-1. The client traffic to virtual server 1 at IP-1 will be load balanced across VM1 and VM2 instances."

The client traffic that reaches virtual server 2 at IP-2 is load balanced across VM5 and VM6 instances. At this point Tenant-A has the service enabled in both the zones, but has no means to set up a disaster recovery plan if one of the zone fails. Additionally, there is no way for Tenant-A to load balance the traffic intelligently to one of the zones based on load, proximity and so on. The cloud administrator of xyztelco provisions a GSLB service provider to both the zones. A GSLB provider is typically an ADC that has the ability to act as an ADNS (Authoritative Domain Name Server) and has the mechanism to monitor health of virtual servers both at local and remote sites.

msgid "When you create other types of network, a network is only a database entry until the first VM is created on that network. When the first VM is created, a VLAN ID is assigned and the network is provisioned. Also, when the last VM is destroyed, the VLAN ID is released and the network is no longer available. With the addition of persistent network, you will have the ability to create a network in CloudStack in which physical devices can be deployed without having to run any VMs. Additionally, you can deploy physical devices on that network."

msgid "One of the advantages of having a persistent network is that you can create a VPC with a tier consisting of only physical devices. For example, you might create a VPC for a three-tier application, deploy VMs for Web and Application tier, and use physical machines for the Database tier. Another use case is that if you are providing services by using physical hardware, you can define the network as persistent and therefore even if all its VMs are destroyed the services will not be discontinued."
