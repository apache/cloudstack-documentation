msgid "When NetScaler load balancer is used to provide EIP or ELB services in a Basic zone, ensure that all guest VM traffic must enter and exit through the NetScaler device. When inbound traffic goes through the NetScaler device, traffic is routed by using the NAT protocol depending on the EIP/ELB configured on the public IP to the private IP. The traffic that is originated from the guest VMs usually goes through the layer 3 router. To ensure that outbound traffic goes through NetScaler device providing EIP/ELB, layer 3 router must have a policy-based routing. A policy-based route must be set up so that all traffic originated from the guest VM's are directed to NetScaler device. This is required to ensure that the outbound traffic from the guest VM's is routed to a public IP by using NAT.For more information on Elastic IP, see `\"About Elastic IP\" <#about-elastic-ip>`_."
